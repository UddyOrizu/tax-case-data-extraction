        "detailed_facts": "The Milton Park Partnership (MPP) was established by MM and EM, commencing on 1 August 2004. The MPP Deed of Partnership outlined profit sharing, management, and ownership of goodwill. In 2005, Brookdale Healthcare Limited (BHL), controlled by MM and EM, joined as a partner, providing personnel and back-office services, but without rights to goodwill or capital. In April 2005, BCSL, another company controlled by MM, joined as a partner, supplying employees to MPP under a Supply of Employees Agreement. BCSL's profit share was tied to employee costs plus a 35% markup, but it also had no rights to goodwill or capital. In July 2005, Milton Park Hospital opened, operated under the names Brookdale and Brookdale Care. In January 2006, BHL received a Health and Safety Executive Improvement Notice, which was complied with. In early 2007, MM and EM discussed restructuring with Haslers, aiming to incorporate the partnerships into limited companies for disclosure and VAT efficiency. The restructure involved removing corporate partners before incorporation, transferring the business to Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL), and forming a new partnership with BCSL. The Brookdale name and logos were registered as trademarks by BHL on 24 May 2007. Milton Park Limited (MPL) was incorporated on 10 August 2007. On 20 November 2007, MM served withdrawal notices on BHL and BCSL, effective from that date, with minutes of board meetings confirming cessation of their partnership memberships and proposals for future staffing arrangements.\nAdmission was given to BCSL to the partnership (MPP) effective from 20 November 2007. On 30 November 2007, board meetings of BCSL and BHL discussed ceasing their membership of MPP on or after 20 December 2007, following notice from MPP dated 20 November 2007. Proposals were made for BCSL and BHL to continue providing specialist staffing services to Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL), which intended to acquire and operate the business under the name Milton Care Partnership (MCP). There were proposals for BCSL and BHL to later join MCP, with profit shares calculated as a percentage uplift on employment costs. Both boards approved the proposals. MPP accounts for the period ended 28 December 2007 show BCSL and BHL became creditors upon cessation of membership, with no formal agreement on payment for staff provided post-membership. On 20 December 2007, MPHL was incorporated in Jersey, with MM and EM as sole shareholders/directors. On 28 December 2007, MM, EM, and MPHL executed a Transfer Agreement for MPHL to acquire the business and assets of MPP as a going concern, including property, goodwill, and other assets, in exchange for shares and assumption of liabilities. On 31 December 2007, MPHL acquired MPL from MM for no consideration. MPHL instructed MPL to manage the care home business. On 1 January 2008, MPL and SM executed the MCP Deed of Partnership, with SM as Managing Partner, and MCP deemed to commence on that date. The goodwill of MCP was to be owned solely by MPHL. On 3 January 2008, BCSL was admitted as a partner to MCP, supplying employees to MCP.\nThis appeal concerns closure notices amending the Appellants’ tax returns to deny Corporation Tax deductions for the amortisation of purchased goodwill and consequent group relief. The Second Appellant, Milton Park Limited (MPL), is the wholly owned subsidiary of the First Appellant, Milton Park Holdings Ltd (MPHL). The central issue is whether the accounts of MPHL for the periods in issue were drawn up in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) for the purposes of Schedule 29 to the Finance Act 2002 (for periods ending before 1 April 2009) and Part 8 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009 (for periods ending on or after 1 April 2009), specifically whether it was in accordance with GAAP for MPHL to recognise any amount in respect of goodwill in those accounts. The valuation of the goodwill, if recognised in accordance with GAAP, has been agreed between the parties. The parties have agreed on the tax consequences depending on whether GAAP-compliant accounts would have recognised goodwill. The case also involves a preliminary issue regarding the late admission of witness statements, which the Tribunal allowed. The burden of proof rests with the Appellants. The evidence included extensive documentation and witness statements from individuals involved in the business and its accounting. The case concerns the affairs of a care home named Milton Park Hospital and another facility, Pathways Latham House, both in Bedfordshire, as well as two other partnerships operating care homes under the names “Brookdale” and “Brookdale Care.” The Milton Park Partnership (MPP) was formed by MM and EM in 2004, and Brookdale Healthcare Limited (BHL), controlled by MM and EM, was admitted as a partner in 2005. Partnership returns were filed, and no HMRC enquiries were opened into those returns.\nThis section details the chronology and terms of several deeds of admission and partnership agreements relating to the Milton Care Partnership (MCP) and its associated entities. On 3 January 2008, MPL, SM, and BCSL executed a Deed of Admission, admitting BCSL as a partner in MCP, with BCSL supplying employees to MCP for eight years in exchange for a profit share. The deed specified that BCSL would not acquire rights to the goodwill or assets of MCP. On 4 April 2008, a similar Deed of Admission was executed to admit BHL as a partner, with BHL supplying administrative staff for seven years, also without rights to goodwill or assets. In May 2008 and in 2009-2010, regulatory visits and reports by the Healthcare Commission and CQC were addressed to BHL as the registered person and owner of the hospital. On 31 March 2009, MPHL resolved to assume MPL's role in the business from 1 April 2009. On 24 September 2009, MM and EM transferred several properties to MPHL and Kemble Holdings Limited, referencing the incorporation of a partnership business under Finance Act 2003. On 17 January 2013, a written resolution extended BCSL's profit share arrangement beyond the original expiry, to satisfy refinancing requirements. On 7 July 2015, EM and MM sold their shares in MPHL to Tracscare. Throughout, BCSL and BHL provided staff and administrative services, and all business was conducted under the 'Brookdale' brand.\nA refinancing process was undertaken to release capital owed to MM and EM for a new care venture. Haslers advised on the process. The partnership agreement with BCSL dated 3 January 2008 had an expiration date of January 2016, which was before the end of the loan term. The bank's solicitors required the agreement to be extended. On 7 July 2015, EM and MM sold their shares in MPHL to Tracscare. The business operated from properties owned by MM and EM until 24 September 2009, when they were transferred to MPHL. BCSL provided staff, BHL provided admin/support staff, and all branding and payments were through BHL. BHL handled regulatory matters as the registered provider. MPHL's accounts from 2007 to 2017 recognised significant goodwill as an intangible asset, with amortisation and impairment charges leading to reported losses. MPL's accounts reported net assets of £1 and profit shares from the partnership. MPHL claimed goodwill amortisation/impairment for corporation tax purposes. MPL claimed group relief based on MPHL's losses. HMRC opened various enquiries into the tax returns of MM, EM, MPHL, and MPL between 2010 and 2018. On 8 March 2019, HMRC closed the enquiries, disallowing goodwill amortisation in MPHL's returns for 2008-2017 and reducing group relief in MPL's 2009 return. These conclusions were upheld on review in July 2019.\nHMRC opened enquiries into the corporation tax returns of MPHL for accounting periods ended 27 December 2008 and 31 March 2009, and of MPL for the accounting period ended 31 March 2009. Between 2011 and 2018, HMRC opened further enquiries into MPHL's corporation tax returns for all periods from 2010 to 2017. On 8 March 2019, HMRC closed these enquiries and concluded that amendments should be made to MPHL's returns for various periods, primarily disallowing goodwill amortisation, resulting in either reduced losses or tax due for certain years. For MPL's return for the period ended 31 March 2009, HMRC reduced the losses available for group relief due to disallowance of goodwill amortisation, resulting in tax due. These conclusions were upheld by HMRC on review and notified to the Appellants by letter dated 15 July 2019. Extensive expert accounting evidence was presented by both parties' experts (PC and Dr Alford), focusing on whether MPHL acquired a business under GAAP, the recognition and derecognition of goodwill, and the substance of the transactions.\nDr Alford's expert evidence addresses the accounting treatment of goodwill in MPHL's accounts from 2009 to 2017. Two possible valuations of goodwill are discussed: £174.59 million (original) and £51.94 million (later agreed). If the lower valuation is accepted, goodwill and amortisation were overstated in MPHL's accounts, making them non-GAAP-compliant. Dr Alford also considers the impact of regulatory requirements (Care Standards Act 2000) on whether MPHL acquired the business and the implications for accounting treatment. She concludes that if MPHL did not acquire the business, recognition of goodwill was not GAAP-compliant. She also discusses how hypothetical regulatory risks and liabilities would affect the valuation and amortisation of goodwill.\nThe case concerns whether MPHL's accounts were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, specifically regarding the recognition of goodwill following the acquisition of the MPP care home business. MPHL acquired the business and its assets, including goodwill valued at £173 million, through a Transfer Agreement with MM and EM in December 2007. MPHL then acquired MPL, which entered into a partnership (MCP) with SM, BHL, and BCSL. MPHL's accounts recognised goodwill and amortised it, resulting in tax deductions and claims for group relief. HMRC disputes whether MPHL acquired a business for accounting purposes and whether goodwill should have been recognised or derecognised following subsequent events, such as the formation of MCP and delegation of operations to MPL. The parties disagree on the application of UK GAAP, the substance over form principle, and the proper recognition and derecognition of goodwill.\nThe case discusses whether MPL acted as an agent for MPHL and whether MPHL retained the risks and rewards of the business after certain transactions. The Tribunal examines evidence such as board minutes, accounting records, and expert testimony. HMRC argues there was no agency agreement between MPL and MPHL, citing the lack of remuneration, benefit, or control by MPHL. The Appellants argue that MPHL retained significant risks and rewards, including rights to sale proceeds and profits, but HMRC contests that these rights were not significant in practice. The Tribunal ultimately finds that MPL was not acting as agent for MPHL and that the operations of MPL passed to MCP.\nThe case concerns the allocation of profits, control over economic benefits, and entitlement to proceeds (including goodwill) arising from a care home business operated by MCP. The legal structure, as set out in the MCP Deed of Partnership, vested control over profit allocation and business operations in the Managing Partner (SM), not in MPHL. The Appellants argued that MPHL retained access to profits and sale proceeds, but the Tribunal found that the authority to determine profit distribution and access to sale proceeds rested with SM. The property assets used by the business were owned by MPHL, but these did not constitute partnership property, and losses would be borne by the partners, not by MPHL's assets. The goodwill clause in the partnership deed referred to legal goodwill, not accounting goodwill, and the Tribunal agreed with HMRC that MPHL did not bear the risks and rewards of the business.\nThe judgment discusses the operation and control of a care home business, specifically whether Milton Care Partnership (MCP) or Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL) was the true operator. The MCP Deed of Partnership was not disputed by any witness or in submissions. MCP's accounts for the period ended 31 March 2008 recorded all turnover and expenses from the care home business, and the partners approved these accounts. The accountants' report clarified that MCP was responsible for the financial information. Witness MM accepted that the accounts gave a true and fair view, though he relied on accountants for the details. The accounts did not show MCP being remunerated as a manager, but rather as the operator. Expert evidence emphasized that MCP, not MPHL, controlled the economic outcomes of the business, as reflected in the accounts. PC, another witness, argued that the accounts could be consistent with MPHL control, but the tribunal found this difficult to reconcile with the substance of the arrangements. HMRC noted that trademarks and customer agreements were in the name of BHL, but the tribunal did not find this determinative. The tribunal considered it more important that BHL and BCSL were admitted as partners in MCP, and that MCP controlled staff and administrative services. There was a submission that MPL acted as agent for MPHL, with reference to board minutes and expert evidence, but the tribunal noted the absence of explicit agency appointment and considered HMRC's arguments that no agency relationship was manifested.",

    "overview": {
        "overview": "This case concerns the formation, operation, and restructuring of the Milton Park Partnership (MPP), a care home business initially operated by MM and EM, later joined by corporate partners BHL and BCSL. The restructuring aimed to achieve VAT efficiency and small company disclosure status by incorporating the partnership and adjusting the partnership structure, including the withdrawal of corporate partners and the transfer of business to new companies.\nThis section details the restructuring of the Milton Park Partnership (MPP), the cessation of BCSL and BHL as partners, and the transfer of the partnership business and assets to a new corporate structure involving Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL) and Milton Care Partnership (MCP). It covers the sequence of board decisions, legal agreements, and the roles of key parties in the transition, including the admission of BCSL to the new partnership and the management arrangements for the care home business.\nThe case involves an appeal by Milton Park Holdings Ltd and Milton Park Ltd against HMRC’s closure notices denying corporation tax deductions for the amortisation of purchased goodwill and related group relief. The main issue is whether the accounts were prepared in accordance with GAAP, affecting the recognition and valuation of goodwill for tax purposes. The Tribunal also addressed procedural matters regarding late witness evidence and considered extensive factual and expert evidence on accounting practice.\nThis section outlines the evolution of the Milton Care Partnership, including the admission of new partners (BCSL and BHL), the terms of their participation, property transfers, regulatory interventions, and changes in business structure and ownership. It details the contractual arrangements for staff supply, profit sharing, and the exclusion of new partners from goodwill and asset rights, as well as compliance with care sector regulations and the eventual sale of the business.\nThe case concerns the tax treatment of goodwill amortisation and group relief claimed by MPHL and MPL following a business restructuring and subsequent sale. HMRC disallowed the amortisation deductions and reduced group relief, leading to a dispute over the correct tax treatment.\nThis section details HMRC's enquiries and amendments to the corporation tax returns of MPHL and MPL, primarily concerning the disallowance of goodwill amortisation and the resulting tax consequences. It also summarises the expert evidence presented on whether MPHL acquired a business for accounting purposes, the appropriate recognition of goodwill, and the implications under UK GAAP.\nThis section discusses the definitions and application of accounting standards relevant to determining whether a business combination occurred for the purposes of the appeal. It contrasts the approaches of the Appellants' and HMRC's experts, focusing on whether UK GAAP (FRSSE, FRS 5, FRS 6) or international standards (IFRS 3, FRED 36) should be applied, and addresses the concepts of 'control' and 'substance over form' in the context of the transfer of assets and operations between entities.\nThis section discusses expert evidence on the accounting treatment of goodwill in MPHL's accounts, considering different valuations and the impact of regulatory requirements on whether a business acquisition occurred. It also sets out the relevant legislation and accounting standards governing the tax treatment of goodwill.\nThe case revolves around whether MPHL was entitled to recognise goodwill in its accounts following the acquisition of the MPP care home business, and whether subsequent arrangements required derecognition of goodwill. The dispute centers on the application of UK GAAP, the definition and recognition of purchased goodwill, and the substance over form of the business arrangements. The outcome affects the allowability of tax deductions and group relief claimed by MPHL and MPL.\nThis section addresses whether MPL acted as agent for MPHL and whether MPHL retained control and the principal risks and rewards of the business after restructuring. The Tribunal considers submissions from both parties, expert evidence, and relevant accounting standards, ultimately siding with HMRC that there was no agency relationship and that MPHL did not retain significant risks or rewards as required by FRS 5.25.\nThe case examines whether MPHL had control over the economic benefits and risks of a care home business operated by MCP, focusing on the allocation of profits, entitlement to sale proceeds, and the ownership of goodwill. The Tribunal analyzed the legal structure and contractual provisions to determine who held control and bore the risks and rewards under GAAP and partnership law.\nThe case concerns the true operator of a care home business and whether MCP or MPHL exercised control and should account for the business's profits and losses. The tribunal examines the substance of the arrangements, the accounting treatment, and the roles of various entities and partners, including arguments about agency and control."

        "dicta": "The Tribunal noted that it was not necessary to address every point made in submissions, but confirmed that all key issues and materials had been considered. The Tribunal accepted the relevance of late witness evidence and clarified that the burden of proof was on the Appellants, applying the civil standard of the balance of probabilities.\nExpert evidence from both parties addressed whether MPHL acquired a business under accounting standards, the proper recognition and derecognition of goodwill, and the substance of the transactions. PC argued MPHL acquired a business and retained principal risks and rewards, while Dr Alford considered whether the substance was that MCP, not MPHL, gained operational control, impacting the GAAP-compliance of goodwill recognition.\nThe Tribunal agreed with HMRC that the applicable UK accounting standards provided a sufficient framework for determining whether a business combination had occurred, and that reliance on international standards was neither required nor supported by the hierarchy of GAAP sources. The Tribunal also accepted that the essential question was whether MPHL obtained control over the net assets and operations of MPP, and that both elements needed to be satisfied. Both parties agreed that the transactions must be assessed according to their commercial substance rather than their legal form.\nDr Alford reiterates that it is for the Tribunal to determine whether MPHL acquired the business and that the accounting treatment depends on this factual determination. She explains that even illegal transactions must be accounted for if they give rise to new assets or liabilities, and that regulatory risks should be considered in valuing goodwill.\nAppellants argue that MPHL acquired a business and retained the risks and rewards, so goodwill recognition was proper and derecognition was not required. HMRC contends that MPHL did not acquire a business for accounting purposes, or if it did, subsequent events required derecognition of goodwill. HMRC emphasizes substance over form, arguing that MCP operated the business and controlled the economic benefits, so MPHL could not recognise goodwill. Legal and accounting definitions of goodwill are discussed, referencing case law such as IRC v Muller & Co’s Margarine Ltd and Tin Tin Yat Pao v Tin Tin.\nBoth parties and their experts agreed that, for proper accounting treatment, it is necessary to analyse the arrangements as a whole to determine which party has access to the risks and rewards. The Tribunal accepted that FRS 5.14 requires an objective assessment of the commercial effect of the arrangements, not a retrospective reconstruction of the parties’ intentions. The Tribunal must assess who had the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of the business with a view to obtaining economic benefits. Legal declarations of ownership cannot override the objective assessment of control required under GAAP.\nThe Tribunal notes the absence of evidence for an agency relationship and comments that the facts point away from such an agreement. It also observes that even if MPL were an agent, this would not establish MPHL's control for GAAP purposes. The Tribunal accepts HMRC's submission that the rights retained by MPHL were not significant in the sense required by FRS 5.25.\nThe Tribunal emphasized that for GAAP purposes, the critical issue is not how profits were actually distributed, but who possesses the authority to control the economic benefits of the business. The absence of a formal agreement securing MPHL's entitlement to profits or sale proceeds reinforces the conclusion that MPHL did not retain control. The distinction between property used by a partnership and partnership property was accepted as legally correct. The goodwill clause was interpreted as referring to legal goodwill, not accounting goodwill.\nThe Tribunal accepted HMRC's submission that the rights retained by MPHL were not 'significant' as required by FRS 5.25. The assessment of significance must be by reference to benefits and risks 'likely to occur in practice', not all possible or contingent outcomes. Rights such as the ability to terminate arrangements, ownership of real property, and entitlement to goodwill were contingent, subject to discretion of others, or incapable of practical enforcement. The MCP Deed of Partnership vested control over profit allocation and sale proceeds in the Managing Partner, SM, not MPHL. The Tribunal found that economic benefits of the business were controlled by MCP, not MPHL, and FRS 5.25 does not support recognition or continued recognition of goodwill in MPHL’s accounts. The Tribunal also found that the power to determine profit shares and access to sale proceeds lay solely with SM as Managing Partner, not MPHL. Any informal family understanding regarding profit allocation was not documented and did not override the legal structure. Subjective expectations cannot displace the objective legal and accounting analysis required under GAAP.\nThe judgment discusses the distinction between legal goodwill and accounting goodwill, emphasizing that the reference to 'goodwill' in the relevant partnership deed clauses is to legal goodwill. The tribunal reviews case law, including Wedderburn v Wedderburn (No 4), Muller, Star Industrial, Geraghty v Minter, and TTYP, to establish that legal goodwill is inseparable from the business to which it attaches and cannot exist independently. The judges cite authoritative statements from these cases, such as Lord Macnaghten's and Lord Lindley's comments in Muller, Lord Diplock's in Star Industrial, and Chief Justice Barwick's and Stephen J's in Geraghty v Minter, all affirming that goodwill is not a separable asset but is inherently tied to the business.\nThe judgment discusses the nature of goodwill as a partnership asset, referencing TTYP and the inseparability principle. It is observed that goodwill is generally associated with the business and is transferable with it, but its status as a partnership asset is ultimately a question of construction based on the partnership agreement and factual context. The Tribunal accepts that the authorities cited by HMRC are of higher status and that the law does not support the proposition that partnership goodwill can be owned by a non-partner. The judgment also discusses the construction of clauses 9.1 and 14.2.1 of the MCP Deed of Partnership, finding that these do not confer a proprietary entitlement to sale proceeds of goodwill to MPHL, but rather create, at most, a contingent contractual debt obligation upon dissolution. The authorities cited in Lindley & Banks and the relevant case law are found to be consistent with the approach that the presumption of goodwill belonging to the firm can be rebutted, but only by clear terms in the agreement, which are not present here.\nThe tribunal found that MCP was operating the business, as reflected in its accounts and the lack of any management fee or remuneration that would indicate it was merely managing the business for someone else. The tribunal did not accept that MPHL was the operator, as it did not record any income or expenditure from the business. The tribunal also found that the fact BHL held trademarks and was the registered person under the Care Standards Act was not determinative of who operated the care home.\nThere is nothing remarkable about goodwill being a partnership asset but held for the benefit of some but not all of the partners or in unequal shares. The presumption that goodwill belongs to the firm is rebuttable and contingent upon the terms of the partnership agreement and the surrounding factual context. The cited cases remain good authority and are properly relied upon in support of the proposition advanced in paragraph 10-100. The position depends on the construction of the relevant agreement, and the reliance on paragraph 10-100 was misplaced in this case. Control, in the relevant sense, requires the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of the entity with a view to obtaining the economic benefits of its activities. Negative control, such as the ability to shut down a business, is not sufficient to constitute control for accounting purposes. Control exercised by an individual in a personal capacity or through other entities does not equate to control by a company. The definition of control under FRS 5.8 is the ability to obtain the future economic benefits relating to an asset and to restrict the access of others to those benefits.",
        "reasoning": "The Tribunal considered the procedural application for late witness evidence, finding the evidence relevant and not unduly prejudicial due to lateness. The Tribunal reviewed extensive documentary and witness evidence, including expert reports on GAAP compliance. The Tribunal’s findings of fact incorporated agreed facts and were based on the evidence presented, including the roles and involvement of key individuals in the relevant businesses and transactions.\nPC's reasoning was that MPHL acquired the assets, processes, and outputs necessary to run the business, and retained the principal risks and rewards, so goodwill should be recognised and not derecognised when MPL managed the business. Dr Alford's reasoning was that under FRS 6, whether MPHL acquired a business depends on the substance of the transaction; if MPHL did not acquire the business, goodwill recognition was not GAAP-compliant. If MPHL did acquire the business but transferred operations to MPL, derecognition of goodwill may have been required. Both experts referenced relevant accounting standards and the factual circumstances to support their views.\nThe Tribunal analyzed the definitions and hierarchy of accounting standards, noting that FRSSE, FRS 5, and FRS 6 were the mandatory sources applicable to the Appellants' financial reporting. The Tribunal found that the UK standards did not require importing definitions from international standards, as the UK standards provided sufficient guidance. The Tribunal also considered expert evidence, which agreed that 'substance over form' was the correct approach, and that the analysis should focus on which party had access to the risks and rewards of the business. The Tribunal accepted that, based on the evidence and the Transfer Agreement, MPHL gained control over the net assets of MPP, subject to a substance-over-form analysis.\nDr Alford's reasoning is based on the application of GAAP and relevant FRS standards. She analyses the impact of different goodwill valuations on the accounts, the effect of regulatory requirements on the acquisition question, and the implications for GAAP compliance. She explains that if MPHL did not acquire the business, recognising goodwill was not GAAP-compliant. She also details how regulatory risks and potential liabilities would affect the net assets acquired and the calculation of goodwill and amortisation.\nThe reasoning involves analysis of the Transfer Agreement, the structure and operation of the partnerships, and the application of UK GAAP and relevant FRS standards. The Appellants rely on the legal documentation and the retention of risks and rewards by MPHL, while HMRC focuses on the actual operation and control of the business, arguing that the substance of the arrangements shows MCP as the true operator. The parties also debate the effectiveness of clauses assigning goodwill and the applicability of various FRS standards and case law to the facts.\nThe Tribunal found that the commercial substance of the arrangements, when viewed as a whole, was that control over the business operations and economic benefits passed to MCP and its Managing Partner, SM. This was supported by the MCP Deed of Partnership, which vested control over profit allocation and operational decisions in SM, and by the financial statements of MCP, which recorded all turnover and operating expenses. MPHL’s accounts recorded no trading income and described its role as a holding company. The Tribunal gave little weight to Clause 9 of the MCP Deed of Partnership, finding it referred to legal goodwill and did not confer control over the economic benefits for accounting purposes. The Tribunal concluded that MCP was carrying on the business for the mutual benefit of its partners, not as managers for someone else, and that the accounts and evidence confirmed this.\nThe Tribunal reasons that there is no documentary or factual basis for an agency relationship between MPL and MPHL, as evidenced by the lack of remuneration, benefit, or control. The Tribunal also finds that the rights retained by MPHL were either contingent or not practically enforceable, and thus not significant for the purposes of FRS 5.25. The Tribunal relies on expert evidence, board minutes, and the structure of the business to reach its conclusion.\nThe Tribunal found that the authority to allocate profits and control access to sale proceeds was vested in the Managing Partner (SM) according to the MCP Deed of Partnership. The Appellants' arguments that MPHL retained access to profits and sale proceeds were rejected, as the legal structure did not provide MPHL with such control. The ownership of property assets by MPHL did not mean that MPHL bore the risks and rewards of the business, as losses would be borne by the partners. The goodwill clause was interpreted as referring only to legal goodwill, not accounting goodwill, and did not support the Appellants' position.\nThe Tribunal reasoned that the rights relied upon by the Appellants were either contingent, subject to the discretion of others, or incapable of practical enforcement. The ability to terminate MPL’s role did not confer on MPHL the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of MCP. Ownership of the real property did not translate into control over the business. The MCP Deed of Partnership gave SM, as Managing Partner, sole power to determine profit allocation and access to sale proceeds. Evidence from witnesses confirmed that SM had autonomy in determining profit shares, and any informal family understanding was not documented or enforceable. The Tribunal emphasized that the substance of the arrangements, as evidenced by legal documentation and actual conduct, must be assessed under GAAP and relevant accounting standards, not by reference to informal or undocumented understandings.\nThe tribunal rejects the appellants' submissions that the partnership deed could allocate legal goodwill to a party other than the partnership itself. They accept HMRC's argument that, even if MPHL had access to proceeds from legal goodwill, there was no evidence or valuation of such goodwill's monetary worth. The tribunal relies on a consistent thread in case law that legal goodwill is inseparable from the business and cannot be owned or transferred apart from it. They analyze the authorities cited by both parties and conclude that, despite any contractual provision, legal goodwill belongs to the partnership and not to an external party such as MPHL.\nThe Tribunal reasons that TTYP and other authorities establish that goodwill is a property right attached to the business and is generally a partnership asset unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise. Clause 9.1 of the MCP Deed of Partnership, on its natural and objective reading, is a declaration of ownership but does not confer an entitlement to sale proceeds. Clause 14.2.1 only creates a contingent debt obligation accruing to MPHL upon dissolution, after debts and liabilities are discharged, and is amendable by the Managing Partner. The Tribunal finds that the cited authorities (Miles v Clarke, Stekel v Ellice, Bhayani v Taylor Bracewell LLP, Castledine v RSM Bentley Jennison) are good law and support the view that while goodwill is usually a partnership asset, this can be rebutted only by clear agreement, which is not the case here. The factual matrix and the terms of the MCP Deed do not support the Appellants' argument that MPHL has a proprietary interest in the goodwill or its proceeds.\nThe tribunal analyzed the accounts, witness evidence, and expert reports, concluding that MCP controlled the business as it recorded all turnover and costs, and there was no evidence of MCP being remunerated as a manager. The tribunal found the expert evidence supporting MCP's control persuasive and noted inconsistencies in the arguments that MPHL was the true operator. The absence of an explicit agency agreement and the lack of remuneration for MPL further undermined the argument that MPL acted as agent for MPHL.\nThe Tribunal found that the presumption that goodwill is a partnership asset was not rebutted by the facts or the terms of the MCP Deed of Partnership. The agreement did not expressly provide that MPHL was entitled to the proceeds of legal goodwill or confer a proprietary interest in that asset. The relevant clauses were silent as to any specific entitlement of MPHL and were amendable at the discretion of the Managing Partner. The factual matrix did not support a departure from the general presumption. The Tribunal also rejected the argument that MPHL retained control over the business by being able to terminate the arrangements or withdraw, as the partnership would continue to operate with the remaining partners and MPHL could not unilaterally reclaim control. The ability to withdraw the use of real property did not amount to control of the business. The Tribunal accepted HMRC's submission that MPHL did not control the business and did not have the ability to direct the financial and operating policies with a view to obtaining economic benefits as required by FRS 5.8. The legal structure established by the MCP Deed of Partnership governed the relationship, and de facto control by an individual did not equate to control by MPHL."

    "decision": {
        "conclusion": "Appeal dismissed.\nThe Tribunal finds that MPL was not acting as agent for MPHL and that MPHL did not retain significant risks or rewards of the business. The operations of MPL passed to MCP.\nThe Tribunal concluded that MPHL did not retain significant benefits or risks in relation to the business following the formation of MCP, and that FRS 5.25 does not support the recognition or continued recognition of goodwill in MPHL’s accounts. Control over profits and sale proceeds lay with SM as Managing Partner, not MPHL.\nThe appeals are dismissed. MPHL did not acquire control over the operations of the Milton Park care home business and did not retain the risks and rewards of that business following the formation of MCP. MPHL did not have the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of the business with a view to obtaining the economic benefits arising from its activities, as required by FRS 5.8. MPHL was not entitled to recognise purchased goodwill in its accounts.",
        "reasoning_summary": "The Tribunal found that the accounts were not drawn up in accordance with GAAP, and therefore the corporation tax deductions for amortisation of purchased goodwill and related group relief were not allowable.\nThe Tribunal concluded that the applicable UK accounting standards were sufficient to determine whether a business combination had occurred and that MPHL appeared to have gained control over the net assets of MPP, subject to further analysis of the substance of the transactions.\nThe Tribunal finds no evidence of an agency relationship and concludes that the rights retained by MPHL were not significant in practice, siding with HMRC's interpretation of the relevant accounting standards.\nThe Tribunal found that legal rights and actual control over economic benefits and profit allocation rested with SM as Managing Partner, not with MPHL, and that informal or subjective expectations could not override the legal and accounting analysis required by GAAP and FRS 5.\nThe Tribunal concluded that control over the business resided with the partnership and its Managing Partner, not with MPHL. The legal and factual context did not support MPHL's entitlement to goodwill or control over the business. The appeals were therefore dismissed."
