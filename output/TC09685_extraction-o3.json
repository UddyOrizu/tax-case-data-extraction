        "detailed_facts": "The appeals concern closure notices issued to Milton Park Holdings Ltd (MPHL) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Milton Park Ltd (MPL), disallowing corporation tax deductions claimed for amortisation and impairment of purchased goodwill and the consequential availability of group relief.  The key issue is whether MPHL’s accounts for the relevant accounting periods were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) for the purposes of Schedule 29 Finance Act 2002 (periods ending before 1 April 2009) and Part 8 Corporation Tax Act 2009 (periods ending on or after 1 April 2009).  If the accounts were not GAAP-compliant, no goodwill should have been recognised and no amortisation or impairment debits (and therefore no group relief) are allowable.  If GAAP-compliant accounts would have recognised goodwill, the parties agree that £51.936 million, not £173 million, should have been recognised and allowable debits and group relief would be reduced accordingly.\n\nA preliminary application made on 24 January 2024 sought the admission of two late witness statements (Janice Ash and Michael McInerney, both dated 15 January 2024).  HMRC objected because Tribunal directions of 1 July 2022 required witness statements to be served by 29 November 2021.  The Tribunal admitted the statements, holding that their relevance outweighed the lateness and that any prejudice could be addressed in submissions on weight.\n\nThe burden of proof lies on the Appellants to show that the closure notice conclusions are wrong, on the balance of probabilities.  The five-day hearing (5–9 February 2024) was transcribed daily and the documentary evidence comprised over 6,000 pages of core bundle, 331 pages of supplementary bundle and 4,378 pages of authorities.  Witness evidence was given by Janice Ash, Lesa McAnulty and Michael McInerney; expert GAAP evidence was provided by Peter Chidgey for the Appellants and Dr Elizabeth Alford for HMRC, who produced reports and a joint statement.\n\nThe factual background involves a care-home business operated on the Milton Park Hospital campus in Bedfordshire.  Michael (MM) and Eunice McInerney (EM) executed a deed on 1 August 2004 creating the Milton Park Partnership (MPP) to operate the business.  A deed dated 1 January 2005 admitted Brookdale Healthcare Ltd (BHL), controlled by MM and EM, as a partner in the MPP.  Partnership tax returns were submitted but not enquired into.  Similar partnership structures existed for other care homes (Kemble & Oakley Partnership and Brookdale Healthcare Partnership).  The appeals ultimately concern whether the subsequent corporate transactions and the accounting treatment of goodwill arising from them complied with GAAP.\nThe section outlines the chronology of the creation, modification and eventual corporate restructuring of the Milton Park Partnership (\"MPP\"), a care-home business originally operated by the individual partners MM and EM.\n\n1. 2004 – Deed creating Milton Park Partnership (MPP)\n   • MPP deemed to have commenced on 1 August 2004.\n   • Monthly profit drawings subject to agreement, with MM (Managing Partner) having final say.\n   • Goodwill jointly owned by MM and EM.\n   • Partnership tax returns were filed with HMRC; no enquiries were opened.\n\n2. 1 January 2005 – Brookdale Healthcare Limited (BHL) admitted as a partner via a Deed of Admission.\n   • BHL to supply full-time and temporary personnel (administrative/management services) to MPP.\n   • MM retained right to review BHL’s services.\n   • Profit-draw clause amended so MM alone decided partners’ drawings.\n   • Goodwill clause amended: BHL received no entitlement to goodwill or partnership assets.\n\n3. 1 April 2005 – Brookdale Care Services Limited (BCSL) admitted as a partner via its own Deed of Admission.\n   • BCSL was already supplying personnel under a Supply of Employees Agreement (1 March 2005).\n   • MPP required to obtain its staffing (other than executive/admin staff) exclusively from BCSL unless BCSL could not supply.\n   • Profit-share clause amended such that BCSL’s share equalled staff costs plus 35 % mark-up, subject to MM’s approval of overall partnership profit sufficiency.\n   • Goodwill clause again excluded BCSL from any entitlement to goodwill or assets.\n\n4. July 2005 – Milton Park Hospital opened at freehold premises owned by MM and EM and operated under the names “Brookdale” and “Brookdale Care”.\n\n5. 16 January 2006 – Health & Safety Executive served an Improvement Notice on BHL (as registered person under the Care Standards Act 2000) following a staff injury; compliance confirmed after an April 2006 visit.\n\n6. Early 2007 – MM and EM engaged accountants Haslers to advise on restructuring. A discussion paper dated 27 March 2007 proposed:\n   • Removing corporate partners (BHL & BCSL) before incorporation to satisfy s162 TCGA 1992 (partnerships with no corporate members).\n   • Transferring the business to Milton Park Holdings Ltd (MPHL) under s162; MPHL would then licence operations to Milton Park Ltd (MPL), which would re-partner with BCSL.\n   • Aims: keep VAT-efficient staffing structure and enable MPHL & MPL to qualify as “small” companies so that the partnership turnover did not appear in their accounts.\n\n7. 24 May 2007 – BHL registered “Brookdale” name and logos as trade marks (the name had been used since the 1990s).\n\n8. 10 August 2007 – MPL incorporated with MM as sole shareholder.\n\n9. 20 November 2007 – MM issued notices of withdrawal to BHL and BCSL (effective 20 December 2007), saying MPP would continue with the remaining partners.\n\n10. 30 November 2007 – Board meetings of both BCSL and BHL recorded acceptance of withdrawal and proposals to continue providing staffing services to the intended corporate successor structure (MPHL/“Milton Care Partnership”) with possible future re-admission and profit share based on employment-cost uplift.\nThis portion of the judgment describes a sequence of corporate and partnership reorganisations involving Brookdale Care Support Limited (BCSL), Brookdale Healthcare Limited (BHL), Milton Park Partnership (MPP), Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL), Milton Park Limited (MPL) and a newly-formed Milton Care Partnership (MCP).\n\nChronology and principal events:\n• 20 November 2007 – BCSL is admitted as a partner of MPP with effect from this date.  On the same date MPP serves notices under clause 7 of the 1 April 2005 Partnership Agreement that BCSL’s and BHL’s membership will cease on or after 20 December 2007.\n\n• 30 November 2007 – Board meetings of both BCSL and BHL are held.  Each board notes that its membership of MPP will cease on or after 20 December 2007 and agrees to continue providing specialist staffing (or, in BHL’s case, administrative) services for an intended purchaser of the business, Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL).  It is envisaged that invitations will later be extended for BCSL and BHL to join a new Milton Care Partnership, with profit share calculated by reference to employment costs.\n\n• 20 December 2007 – BCSL’s and BHL’s membership of MPP ceases.  On the same day MPHL is incorporated in Jersey with MM and EM (both UK-resident) as sole shareholders and directors.\n\n• 28 December 2007 – MM, EM and MPHL execute a “Transfer of Partnership Assets & Liabilities Agreement”.  Under this deed MPHL purchases the business of MPP as a going concern, including freehold property, goodwill valued at £173 m and other assets, and assumes partnership liabilities.  Consideration is the allotment of 10,000 fully-paid £1 ordinary shares in MPHL to MM and EM (5,000 each).  A long list of operational records, care plans, medical equipment etc. is also transferred to MPHL.  Schedule 2 records creditors of £9,517,207.\n\n• 31 December 2007 – MPHL acquires the entire shareholding of MPL from MM for no consideration.  MPHL board minutes approve the acquisition of the partnership assets and delegate day-to-day management of the care-home business to MPL.  MPL board minutes accept that delegation and resolve to seek partners to carry on the business.\n\n• 1 January 2008 – MPL and Sean McInerney (SM) execute the MCP Deed of Partnership.  Key terms: the partnership (MCP) is deemed to commence on 1 January 2008; SM is Managing Partner with autonomy over profit drawings; goodwill is owned solely by MPHL; provisions govern withdrawal of partners and vesting of partnership property.\n\n• 3 January 2008 – MPL, SM and BCSL execute the BCSL Deed of Admission to MCP.  BCSL is admitted as a partner for an 8-year term from 3 January 2008 and agrees to continue supplying employees to MCP.  No separate fee was paid to BCSL for staff supplied between 21 December 2007 and 3 January 2008.\n\n• Accounts for MPP to 28 December 2007 show BCSL and BHL as creditors on cessation.  Their allocated profit shares relate to 1 April 2006–28 December 2007.  No formal agreement governed post-cessation payments to BCSL and BHL until April 2008.  MCP’s 2008 accounts show no capital contributed by partners; partners’ current accounts record shares of profit for MPL, BCSL and SM.\n\n• 29 May 2009 – MPHL registers a branch in the UK (mentioned for context).\nThe chunk describes a series of deeds, resolutions, inspections and property transfers relating to the Milton Care Partnership (MCP) and Milton Park Hospital (MPH).\n\n3 January 2008 – Milton Park Limited (MPL), Stuart Milne (SM) and Brookdale Care Services Limited (BCSL) executed a Deed of Admission (“BCSL Deed of Admission to MCP”).  Key terms included: BCSL admitted as a partner in MCP; supply of employees by BCSL to MCP for an eight-year term; MCP obliged to obtain virtually all of its employee requirements from BCSL; SM retained a right to withdraw BCSL on 30-days’ notice upon disposal of goodwill; BCSL’s profit share was defined as employee-emolument cost plus 35 % (subject to SM’s agreement that sufficient overall partnership profit existed); goodwill remained with Milton Park Healthcare Limited (MPHL) and BCSL had no entitlement to it or to any disposal proceeds.\n\n4 April 2008 – MPL, SM, BCSL and Brookdale Healthcare Limited (BHL) executed a further Deed of Admission (“BHL Deed of Admission to MCP”).  BHL was admitted as partner from 4 April 2008; a seven-year employee-supply arrangement began; procurement obligations mirrored those in the BCSL deed; SM could withdraw BHL on 30-days’ notice on disposal of goodwill; BHL’s profit share equalled residual partnership profit (subject to SM’s agreement that sufficient profit existed); goodwill remained with MPHL and BHL had no entitlement.\n\nMay 2008 – After a patient incident, the Healthcare Commission inspected Milton Park Hospital.  A statutory notice was served on BHL (as the registered person) on 12 May 2008.  In September 2008 the Commission issued a report addressed to BHL and describing the hospital as owned by BHL.  The report recorded that breaches had been remedied and the notices complied with.\n\n2009–2010 – The Care Quality Commission (CQC) undertook visits; its report was addressed to BHL and referred to the hospital as owned by BHL.\n\n31 March 2009 – Minutes of MPHL’s board recorded that MPHL had appointed MPL to assume its role in the Milton Park Hospital business and resolved that MPHL itself would assume that role with effect from 1 April 2009.  The minutes referred to the 1 January 2008 partnership deed and the deeds admitting BCSL and BHL, and confirmed that MPHL would stand in MPL’s place for day-to-day management from 1 April 2009.\n\n24 September 2009 – MM and EM executed TR1 transfer deeds transferring several properties (Latham House; The Manor; land/buildings known as Milton Park) to MPHL and two additional properties to Kemble Holdings Limited.  Each TR1 cited “Finance Act 2003 Schedule 15 Part 3 Incorporation of a Partnership Business to a Connected Company” as the consideration.\n\n17 January 2013 – A written resolution of the partners of Milton Care Partnership extended the BCSL arrangement beyond its original expiry (January 2016) to continue until 30-days’ notice is served, and set the profit-share calculation as salary costs plus an agreed uplift of 0–35 % to be agreed annually.  The resolution formed part of a refinancing process to release capital to MM and EM; bank solicitors required confirmation that the agreement would extend for the loan term.\n\n7 July 2015 – EM and MM sold their shares in MPHL to Tracscare, an unrelated UK care-provider.\n\nOperational background (from July 2005 onwards): the business operated from properties owned by MM and EM (later transferred to MPHL in 2009); BCSL provided hospital staff; BHL supplied administrative/support staff; all customer-facing documentation used the “Brookdale” name and logo, a registered trademark of BHL.\nThis section details the commercial and accounting background to the activities of Milton Park Hospital Limited (\"MPHL\"), Milton Park Limited (\"MPL\"), Brookdale Care Services Limited (\"BCSL\") and Brookdale Healthcare Limited (\"BHL\").  \n\n•  A refinancing process was undertaken in 2015 to release capital owed to MM and EM so that they could pursue a new care venture.  During that process Haslers discovered that the partnership agreement between the Brookdale entities and BCSL dated 3 January 2008 was due to expire in January 2016, i.e. before the end of the proposed new bank loan.  Consequently a written resolution was prepared stating that staff-related management charges would be calculated as “full salary costs incurred together with an addition … between zero per cent and 35 per cent”, with the addition to be agreed annually by the partners.\n\n•  On 7 July 2015 MM and EM sold their shares in MPHL to Tracscare, an unrelated UK care-provider.\n\nOperational structure from July 2005 onwards:\n(a) The business operated from properties owned by MM and EM rent-free until 24 September 2009, when the properties were transferred to MPHL.\n(b) BCSL supplied clinical staff to Milton Park Hospital.\n(c) BHL supplied administrative and support staff and held the registered trade marks “Brookdale” and “Brookdale Care” (registered 24 May 2007).\n(d) All customer agreements, invoices and marketing materials used the Brookdale branding, BHL’s registered address (14 Parkway, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, AL8 6HG) and required payment into a BHL bank account.\n\nRegulatory matters: BHL was the registered provider with the Care Quality Commission (under the Care Standards Act 2000) and provided the registered manager and responsible individual for Milton Park Hospital and the other care homes in the Brookdale group.  MM regarded BHL as the group registration holder.\n\nMPHL financial statements:\n•  Accounts for the period 28 Dec 2007–31 Mar 2009 recognised goodwill of £173 m arising from the “Transfer of Partnership Assets & Liabilities Agreement” of 28 Dec 2007.  Amortisation of £10.812 m produced a loss before tax of £9.663 m.\n•  Subsequent accounts up to 31 Mar 2015 continued to recognise goodwill (after amortisation/impairment) and to post large losses mainly attributable to amortisation.  Goodwill figures at year-end were: 2009 £173 m; 2010 £129.75 m (after £32.437 m impairment); 2011 £122.542 m; 2012 £115.333 m; 2013 £108.125 m; 2014 £100.917 m; 2015 £93.708 m.\n•  Accounts for 31 Mar 2016 restated goodwill to £51.936 m citing a prior-period error and shortened useful life to 10 years.  Amortisation for the period was £5.194 m.  \n•  Accounts for 31 Mar 2017 corrected goodwill cost to £140.563 m with an offsetting correction to accumulated amortisation.  Amortisation charged was again £5.194 m.\n\nMPHL showed little or no turnover between 2008 and 2017; income in 2009 consisted solely of £2.18 m dividends from its subsidiary Milton Park Limited.  Directors’ reports variously describe the company as acting as a holding company or as a trading entity operating the former Milton Park Partnership business.\n\nMPL financial statements: net assets of £1 reported 2008-2012.  Investment in “the Milton Care Partnership” initially at £nil, later increased by MPL’s £2.1 m profit share for the first three months of trading.  Turnover was stated to comprise MPL’s profit share from that partnership.\n\nTax treatment claimed:\n•  For every accounting period 2008-2017, MPHL deducted the goodwill amortisation/impairment in computing its corporation-tax profit/loss.\n•  For the period ended 31 Mar 2009, MPL made a trading profit of £932,358 and claimed group relief for the full amount, matched to MPHL’s loss created by the goodwill amortisation.\n\nHMRC enquiries:\n•  18 & 5 Jan 2010 – enquiries into MM and EM personal tax returns (y/e 5 Apr 2008) closed with no adjustments (s162 TCGA 1992 roll-over applied).\n•  11 Oct 2010 – enquiry into MPL’s CT return for period ended 31 Mar 2009.\n•  16 Dec 2010 – enquiries into MPHL (periods ended 27 Dec 2008 and 31 Mar 2009) and MPL (31 Mar 2009).\n•  2011-2018 – further enquiries into all MPHL returns 2010-2017.\n•  8 Mar 2019 – HMRC closed enquiries, disallowing the goodwill amortisation for each period.  Specific disallowances and resulting corporation-tax liabilities were set out for each accounting period 2008-2017 (e.g. £32.437 m disallowed in 2010 leading to tax of £76,083.84; disallowance of £2.364 m in 2017 leading to tax of £78,764.80).  For MPL, group-relief losses were reduced by £738,927, producing tax of £206,899.56 for period ended 31 Mar 2009.\n•  15 Jul 2019 – HMRC review upheld the amendments.\nThe judgment section discusses whether the transactions between MPHL (one of the Appellants) and MPP amounted to a \"business combination\" for UK GAAP purposes and, specifically, whether MPHL acquired a business and obtained control over MPP’s net assets and operations. \n\nKey elements extracted from the evidence include:\n•  There was a Transfer Agreement under which various freehold properties and the net assets of MPP (with certain exceptions) were transferred.  \n•  Expert evidence: PC gave evidence for the Appellants, while EA appeared for HMRC.  PC initially relied on international accounting standards (IFRS 3 and FRED 36) to define a business, arguing that the FRSSE allows reference to \"other accounting standards and UITF abstracts\" where the FRSSE is silent.  HMRC’s expert and the Tribunal found that, because FRS 6 and FRSSE were applicable and in force, reference to IFRS 3 or FRED 36 was unnecessary and not justified.  \n•  It was accepted that a merger was not in issue, so the only question under FRS 6 was whether MPHL obtained control over the net assets and operations of MPP.  Both parties accepted that both limbs (net assets and operations) had to be satisfied.  \n•  EA’s first report (paragraph 6.33) concluded—assuming the Transfer Agreement reflected the true facts—that MPHL did gain control over the freehold properties (save Manor Farm) and, separately, over MPP’s net assets (save cash balances and certain tax-related balances).  \n•  HMRC accepted in its skeleton argument that control over the net assets appeared to be met in favour of MPHL, subject to a substance-over-form analysis.  HMRC did not challenge witness evidence that the Transfer Agreement was executed as written.  \n•  Both parties agreed that, in accordance with FRSSE 2.2 and FRS 5.14, the substance rather than the legal form of the transactions had to be considered, and that a series of transactions should be viewed as a whole to identify who has the risks and rewards of ownership.  \n•  Definitions of “control” from FRS 5 and the ASB Statement of Principles were set out, emphasising the ability to direct financial and operating policies and to obtain benefits (and bear risks) from the assets concerned.\nThe dispute concerns whether the accounts of MPHL were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP in recognising purchased goodwill arising from MPHL’s acquisition of the MPP care-home business.  \nChronology and events:\n• December 2007 – MPHL was incorporated and entered into a Transfer Agreement with MM and EM to acquire the MPP care-home business and its assets, including goodwill valued at £173 million.\n• After this acquisition MPHL acquired MPL, which entered into a partnership (MCP) initially with SM and later with BHL and BCSL to run the care-home business.\n• MPHL’s accounts recognised and amortised the goodwill, giving rise to tax deductions and claims for group relief in the years 2009-2017.\n• The MCP Partnership Deed (date not stated) said goodwill belonged to MPHL; MPHL retained a power to revoke the arrangement and did so after about 15 months.\n• HMRC subsequently opened extensive enquiries challenging recognition of the goodwill and the resulting tax reliefs.\n• Applicable GAAP during the relevant periods were: FRSSE (2009-2015) and FRS 102 (2016-2017).\nThe extract describes a restructuring of the Milton Park care-home business.  A series of transactions executed over about five days in late March 2007 were designed to move the business from Milton Park Partnership (MPP) to Milton Park Holdings Ltd (MPHL) and finally to Milton Care Partnership (MCP).  Both the Appellants’ expert (PC) and HMRC’s expert (EA) agreed that, under GAAP, the transactions must be considered as a whole to identify who controls the business and may recognise goodwill.  \n\nA discussion paper dated 27 March 2007 explained the plan.  On 1 January 2008 a Deed of Partnership was signed between MPL (a corporate partner) and Sean McInerney (SM) establishing MCP, with SM as Managing Partner.  The Deed stated the partners would carry on the care-home business for their mutual benefit.  \n\nThe accounts of MCP for the year ended 31 March 2008 recorded all turnover, expenses and profit (£2,542,132); certificates were signed by MPL, BCSL and SM confirming approval and provision of records.  MPHL’s accounts recorded no trading income and described MPHL as a holding company.  \n\nWitnesses MM and JA acknowledged in cross-examination that the objective and effect of the steps was to transfer the business from MPP to MCP.  The Tribunal therefore analysed whether MPHL ever controlled the business or whether control passed directly to MCP.\nThe Tribunal considered whether Medomsley Properties Holdings Limited (MPHL) retained control over a care-home business after corporate restructuring in late 2007/early 2008. HMRC argued that Medomsley Properties Limited (MPL) – which operated the business through Medomsley Care Partnership (MCP) – was not MPHL’s agent.\n\nKey HMRC points showing no agency: (i) no written agency agreement; (ii) no remuneration or commission for MPL; (iii) no obvious benefit to MPHL; (iv) no limits on MPL’s discretion (minutes state MPL had “full autonomy”); (v) accounting treatment – MPL’s 31 March 2008 accounts recorded turnover from MCP whereas MPHL’s 31 March 2009 accounts recognised no such turnover.\n\nExpert accountant PC acknowledged that if MPL were an agent the profit share should have been recognised by MPHL, not MPL, under FRS 5 Application Note G.  This supported HMRC’s stance that no agency existed.\n\nWitnesses MM and JA confirmed they regarded MPL as a subsidiary of MPHL, not an agent.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that, even if MPL were an agent, MPHL still lacked the control required by FRS 5.8; therefore the appellants’ agency argument failed and “the operations of MPL passed to MCP”.\n\nThe Tribunal then considered whether MPHL retained the significant benefits and risks of the business for FRS 5 purposes.  MPHL claimed it retained the right to sale proceeds, could terminate the arrangements, and owned the property used by the business.  HMRC (supported by expert EA) said these rights were contingent, effectively unenforceable or subject to others’ discretion and did not confer control.  Applying FRS 5.25, the Tribunal agreed with HMRC that the rights were not “significant” in practice.\nThe discussion centres on whether Milton Care Partnership (MCP) was the entity operating the Milton Park Hospital care-home business or whether Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL) retained ownership and control, with Milton Park Limited (MPL) merely acting as MPHL’s agent.\n\n• MCP’s accounts for the period ended 31 March 2008 show all turnover and operating expenses from the care-home business, disclosing a profit of £2,542,132.  The Partners’ Certificate (signed by MPL, BCSL and SM) confirmed the accounts and responsibility for them.  The Accountants’ Report (engagement letter dated 28 January 2009) confirmed the compilation of those accounts from information supplied by the partners.\n\n• MM, when cross-examined, accepted that MCP’s accounts gave a true and fair view and that he had signed them, relying on Haslers (the accountants).\n\n• Examination of “cost of sales” in MCP’s accounts shows typical care-home running costs and no management fees or commissions that would be expected if MCP were merely managing a business for someone else.\n\n• Expert EA (Dr Alford) regarded the fact that all turnover was reported by MCP, not MPHL, as indicating that MCP exercised control over gains, losses, assets and liabilities in line with Statement of Principles (SOP) 2.6.\n\n• Expert PC argued in cross-examination that the accounts were not necessarily inconsistent with MPHL’s control, but the tribunal questioned how MPHL could be said to control a business whose turnover and costs it did not recognise.\n\n• HMRC pointed out that trademarks, customer agreements and Care Standards Act 2000 registration were in the name of BHL, but the tribunal considered this non-determinative; what mattered was that BHL and BCSL were partners in MCP and that MCP (through managing partner SM) controlled staff and administrative services.\n\n• Appellants contended that MPL acted as agent for MPHL.  Reliance was placed on MPL board minutes of 31 December 2007 stating that MPL would, “on behalf of MPHL, … conduct the day-to-day management and execution of a care-home business recently acquired by MPHL.”  MPL’s role could be terminated at will and was in fact dispensed with by MPHL board minutes dated 31 March 2009.\n\n• PC’s expert report suggested MPL was an undisclosed agent, and under FRS 5 Application Note G, MPHL rather than MPL should have accounted for profits if agency existed.\n\n• The tribunal noted that MPHL board minutes of 31 December 2007 did not record MPL’s appointment as agent, and HMRC argued there was no express or implied agency as defined in Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency, 23rd ed.\nThis section records the parties’ arguments and the Tribunal’s interim observations on the ownership and valuation of “goodwill” under the MCP Deed of Partnership.\n•  Clause 9.1 of the MCP Deed of Partnership states that “The goodwill of the Partnership shall be owned solely by MPHL.”\n•  During oral submissions Mr Sykes (for the Appellants) accepted that the word “goodwill” in Clauses 9 and 14 must mean legal goodwill (as opposed to accounting goodwill).\n•  Mr Sykes argued that the clause gives MPHL entitlement to any sale proceeds attributable to legal goodwill and that the clause should be construed so as to have commercial effect and avoid being void or ineffective.\n•  HMRC contended that MPHL did not bear the risks and rewards of the business via legal goodwill and, even if MPHL had access to such proceeds, there was no evidence or agreed valuation showing that the legal goodwill had any monetary worth.\n•  The Tribunal accepted that there is no evidence before it of the value, if any, of the legal goodwill of the business.\n•  Mr Winter, for HMRC, reviewed authorities establishing that legal goodwill is inseparable from the business to which it relates.\n•  The Tribunal noted that, according to those authorities and the definition of “Partnership” in the Deed, legal goodwill relating to the MCP business belonged to the partnership itself and not MPHL, despite any contractual provision to the contrary.\nThe section concerns whether Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL) retained control of and access to the economic benefits, risks and rewards generated by a care-home business conducted through Milton Park Partnership (MCP).\n\n• The Managing Partner of MCP, Sean (SM), possessed sole contractual power under Clause 8.2 of the MCP Deed of Partnership to determine each partner’s profit share at the end of every accounting period.\n• Expert witness PC originally suggested that MPHL effectively controlled at least 90 % of the residual profits, but under cross-examination accepted that, for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) purposes, actual profit allocations are irrelevant; the key question is who has authority to decide future distributions. The Tribunal found that this authority lay with SM and not MPHL.\n• Appellants argued it was improbable MPHL would have entered the arrangements without agreement on profit allocation, but the Tribunal held subjective intentions cannot override the objective legal position required by GAAP.\n• Clause 14 of the MCP Deed of Partnership (headed “Dissolution”) governs allocation of sale proceeds. Clause 14.2 provides that, on dissolution, surplus is shared in profit-sharing proportions immediately prior to dissolution, determined by the Managing Partner.\n• Appellants’ expert contended MPHL retained access to sale proceeds because admission deeds tightly controlled entry and withdrawal of partners, but HMRC pointed out that control still lay with SM.\n• PC further argued that MPHL bore business risk because it owned the real property assets. The Tribunal accepted a legal distinction that property used by a partnership need not be partnership property; thus losses would fall on the partners, not automatically on MPHL’s property assets.\n• Clause 9 of the MCP Deed states that goodwill “shall be owned solely by MPHL.” Deeds of Admission dated 1 January 2005 (BHL) and 1 April 2005 (BCSL) confirm goodwill and any consideration on disposal belong only to existing partners MPL and SM. Appellants said this demonstrated retention of rewards by MPHL. During submissions it was accepted that Clause 9 referred only to legal goodwill, not accounting goodwill.\n• HMRC maintained that MPHL did not bear the risks and rewards of the business despite ownership of legal goodwill or real property, because operative control under GAAP rested with the Managing Partner.\nThe Tribunal considered whether clauses in the MCP Deed of Partnership conferred upon MPHL ownership of, or entitlement to the proceeds of, the partnership’s legal goodwill.  The relevant provisions were:\n• Clause 9.1 – “the goodwill of the partnership shall be owned solely by MPHL”.  \n• Clause 14 (dissolution) – particularly clause 14.2.1 which directs that, on dissolution and after discharge of debts and liabilities, any sum realised from the disposal of the business goodwill “shall accrue solely to MPHL”.\n\nHMRC argued that Clause 9.1 is a mere declaration of ownership that does not grant MPHL any present proprietary right to future sale proceeds and that the language of Clause 14.2.1 creates only a contingent debt obligation arising on dissolution, not a present proprietary entitlement.  They further noted that the MCP Deed is amendable by the Managing Partner, so MPHL has no secured right to any future proceeds.\n\nThe Appellants contended that, on a commonsense construction, the clauses did grant MPHL ownership (and thus entitlement to future proceeds) of legal goodwill.  They relied on textbook commentary (Lindley & Banks on Partnership) and sought to distinguish or undermine authorities cited by HMRC.\n\nThe Tribunal reviewed authorities including Star Industrial, Muller, Wood v Hall, TTYP, Miles v Clarke, Stekel v Ellice, Bhayani v Taylor Bracewell LLP and Castledine v RSM Bentley Jennison, and textbook passages (Lindley & Banks, paragraphs 10-17, 10-100 & 18.58).  It rejected submissions that goodwill can be owned by a non-partner in the circumstances alleged and accepted HMRC’s construction of the clauses.",

    "overview": {
        "overview": "The case concerns whether Milton Park Holdings Ltd’s accounts correctly recognised purchased goodwill in accordance with GAAP.  HMRC amended the companies’ returns to disallow amortisation/impairment deductions and related group relief.  The Tribunal had to decide (1) whether GAAP permitted any goodwill to be recognised and, if so, in what amount, and (2) the tax consequences under FA 2002 and CTA 2009.  The Appellants also sought late admission of additional witness evidence, which the Tribunal allowed.\nChronicles formation of Milton Park Partnership, admission of corporate partners supplying management and staffing services, opening of Milton Park Hospital, regulatory interaction with HSE, and 2007 planning to incorporate the business into MPHL/MPL to maintain VAT-efficient workforce supply while benefiting from small-company accounting disclosure. It also records withdrawal of the corporate partners in preparation for the s162 TCGA 1992 incorporation.\nThis excerpt details a sequence of partnership admissions, regulatory inspections, internal restructuring, property transfers under Finance Act 2003 Schedule 15, a refinancing-linked partnership resolution and the ultimate sale of the holding company’s shares, all relating to the operation of Milton Park Hospital by the Milton Care Partnership and associated companies between 2008 and 2015.\nOverview of accounting and tax issues surrounding MPHL's recognition and amortisation of £173m goodwill, the resulting corporation-tax deductions, group relief claimed by MPL, and HMRC's enquiries (2010-2019) culminating in disallowance of the goodwill amortisation and corresponding tax assessments.\nThis portion of the judgment examines whether the transactions between MPHL and MPP constituted a business combination under UK GAAP. The dispute centres on whether MPHL obtained control over MPP’s net assets and operations, thereby recognising purchased goodwill. The Tribunal compares expert evidence, determines the proper hierarchy of GAAP sources, rejects reliance on IFRS 3/FRED 36, and considers ‘control’ and substance-over-form principles under FRSSE and FRS 5 and 6.\nThe case concerns MPHL’s recognition and amortisation of £173 million of purchased goodwill following its 2007 acquisition of the MPP care-home business. HMRC contends that MPHL did not acquire a business for accounting purposes, or alternatively that later arrangements meant goodwill should have been derecognised, so related tax deductions and group relief are disallowed. The Tribunal must determine whether MPHL’s accounts complied with UK GAAP and the resultant tax consequences.\nApplying accounting standards FRSSE 2.2 and FRS 5, the Tribunal examined a pre-arranged restructuring that purported to leave the goodwill of a care-home business with MPHL while operational control was placed with a new partnership, MCP.  It focused on which entity truly controlled the business and bore the risks and rewards.  Evidence (Deed terms, partners’ testimony, and MCP accounts) showed MCP, led by SM, directed operations and received economic benefits, so MPHL could not recognise goodwill.\nThis part of the judgment analyses (1) whether MPL was MPHL’s agent and (2) whether MPHL retained the significant risks and rewards of the care-home business under FRS 5.  In light of documentary, accounting and witness evidence, the Tribunal rejected the appellants’ agency argument and held that MPHL did not retain significant benefits or risks; operational control had passed to MCP.\nExtract focuses on whether MCP or MPHL controlled and operated the Milton Park Hospital care-home business. Accounting records, expert evidence, and board minutes are examined to determine if MCP was genuinely the operating entity or merely a manager/agent. HMRC contends MCP controlled the business, whereas appellants argue MPL acted as agent for MPHL.\nThe extract addresses whether legal goodwill arising from the MCP partnership business can be owned separately by MPHL under Clause 9 of the partnership deed.  The Appellants argue that the clause vests such goodwill (and related sale proceeds) in MPHL, while HMRC relies on authority that legal goodwill is inseparable from the business and therefore belongs to the partnership.  The Tribunal reviews relevant case law and notes the absence of any valuation evidence for the goodwill.\nDispute focuses on whether MPHL retained control, risks and rewards of a care-home business operated through MCP for accounting (GAAP) and tax purposes. Key contractual provisions, expert evidence and partnership deeds are analysed to determine locus of economic control.\nThis part of the judgment addresses whether, under the MCP Deed of Partnership, Goodwill of the partnership could be owned by MPHL—a company that was not a partner—and whether MPHL had any proprietary or contractual right to the proceeds of goodwill on a sale or dissolution.  The Tribunal analyses contractual construction principles, partnership law presumptions, and relevant case law to determine the status of goodwill and MPHL’s rights."

    "judges_comments": {
        "dicta": "The Tribunal noted that the burden of proof rests on the Appellants to displace HMRC’s closure notice conclusions and that the ordinary civil standard (balance of probabilities) applies.  In addressing the late evidence, it observed that relevance and the ability to test the evidence at the hearing outweighed the procedural delay and that any prejudice could be mitigated by submissions on weight.\nThe Tribunal observes that UK standards (FRSSE, FRS 5, FRS 6) provide a sufficient framework and no definition need be imported from IFRS 3 or FRED 36. It agrees that the critical inquiry is whether MPHL obtained control over MPP’s net assets and operations. The Tribunal also emphasises that GAAP requires transactions to be accounted for in accordance with their substance, not merely their legal form.\n\"A group or series of transactions that achieves or is designed to achieve an overall commercial effect should be viewed as a whole… The Tribunal must assess who had the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of the business with a view to obtaining economic benefits.\"\nEven if MPL were acting as agent, that would not in itself establish MPHL’s control for GAAP purposes; FRS 5.8 requires the ability to direct financial and operating policies with a view to obtaining economic benefits.\nThe tribunal stressed substance over form, noting MPHL’s failure to record turnover/expenditure was “inconsistent with the requirements of SOP 2.6 and undermines the notion that MPHL presented a true and fair view of its financial position.” PC’s view was described as “difficult to reconcile with the substance of the arrangements.”\nHighlighted dicta include:\n• Halsbury’s Laws of England: “Goodwill is not a thing which can be separated and dealt with apart from the business out of which it arises.”\n• Wedderburn v Wedderburn: goodwill is partnership property inseparable from the business.\n• Lord MacNaghten in Muller: “goodwill has no independent existence. It cannot subsist by itself. It must be attached to a business.”\n• Lord Diplock in Star Industrial: Goodwill is “incapable of subsisting by itself… It has no independent existence apart from the business to which it is attached.”\n• Chief Justice Barwick in Geraghty v Minter: “goodwill is not something which can be conveyed or held in gross: it is something which attaches to a business.”\nTribunal observed that the crucial GAAP issue is the locus of authority to decide the distribution of future economic benefits, not the actual allocation history. It found this power resided exclusively with SM under Clause 8.2. The lack of a binding agreement giving MPHL profit rights reinforced that MPHL lacked control. Ownership of legal goodwill or property did not equate to control under GAAP.\nThe Tribunal emphasised that goodwill is generally presumed to be a partnership asset unless the partnership agreement and surrounding facts demonstrate otherwise. It held that clause 9.1 and clause 14.2.1 of the MCP Deed did not confer any proprietary entitlement to goodwill on MPHL and that paragraph 10-100 of Lindley & Banks does not establish a rule that goodwill may freely be allocated to non-partners; the position depends on construction of the relevant agreement. The Tribunal rejected the submission that MPHL’s ability to \"terminate\" or \"withdraw\" from arrangements equated to control of the business, noting that negative control is insufficient and that true control is the ability to direct financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits.\n“Ownership of an asset (here, legal goodwill) does not automatically equate to a right to proceeds from a future sale of that asset, particularly in the absence of express language to that effect.”\n\n“A right or obligation that accrues is one that arises or comes into existence upon the occurrence of a specified event, in this case the dissolution of the partnership. It does not denote a present proprietary entitlement to the underlying asset or its proceeds.”",
        "reasoning": "The Tribunal considered the procedural fairness of admitting late witness statements, balancing relevance and prejudice; it admitted the evidence.  On the substantive issue, it analysed whether MPHL’s accounting treatment of goodwill complied with GAAP in light of expert evidence and agreed facts.  It concluded that GAAP would not have permitted recognition of goodwill in the amounts claimed.  Consequently, the claimed amortisation and impairment debits and group relief were not allowable.\nApplying the GAAP hierarchy, the Tribunal accepts HMRC’s submission that FRS 6 governs business combinations and relies on FRS 5’s definition of control. Investigating control requires assessing who directs financial and operating policies and who bears the risks and rewards. Both experts agree that control over net assets appears satisfied by MPHL, but the Tribunal will continue to examine substantive control over operations, considering the transactions as a whole in line with FRSSE 2.2 and FRS 5.14.\nThe Tribunal, guided by FRS 5.14, conducted an objective assessment of the commercial substance of the arrangements.  Both experts agreed that the arrangements had to be considered as a whole.  It noted that MCP carried on the business for the mutual benefit of its partners; SM, as Managing Partner, controlled profit allocation; and MCP’s accounts recorded all trading results.  Conversely, MPHL had no trading income and functioned only as a holding company.  These factors outweighed a clause purporting to reserve goodwill to MPHL.  Therefore, control and economic benefits lay with MCP, precluding MPHL from recognising goodwill.\nThe Tribunal relied on (i) lack of any express or implied agency agreement, (ii) absence of remuneration terms, (iii) absence of limits on MPL’s authority, (iv) accounting treatment inconsistent with agency, and (v) witness evidence that MPL was understood as a subsidiary, not an agent.  For risks/rewards, the Tribunal applied FRS 5.25 and found that the rights claimed by MPHL were contingent or practically ineffective and therefore not ‘significant’.\n1. Accounting evidence shows MCP recorded all turnover and costs and no management-fee income, indicating operational control.\n2. Expert EA’s reliance on SOP 2.6 supports MCP’s control; PC’s contrary opinion focuses on ultimate profit distribution rather than operational control and is unconvincing.\n3. Documentary evidence (partners’ certificates, accountants’ report, board minutes) shows MCP assumed responsibility; MPHL board minutes do not record agency appointment.\n4. Applying the legal definition of agency in Bowstead & Reynolds, there is no express or implied agency: no remuneration, benefit or documentation demonstrates such a relationship.\n5. Consequently, HMRC’s view that MCP—not MPHL—operated the care-home business is preferred.\n1. The word “goodwill” in the MCP Deed must mean legal goodwill, as conceded by the Appellants.\n2. Legal goodwill, according to established authority, cannot exist independently of the business; it attaches to and is part of the partnership property.\n3. Therefore, despite Clause 9.1 purporting to vest goodwill in MPHL, the legal goodwill arising from the MCP business belongs to the partnership, not MPHL.\n4. Even if MPHL could claim proceeds attributable to goodwill, no evidence or valuation has been provided as to any monetary worth, making the claim speculative.\n5. Consequently, HMRC’s construction is preferred and the clause does not have the effect asserted by the Appellants.\nBy examining Clause 8 (profit allocation) and Clause 14 (dissolution and sale proceeds) of the MCP Deed, the Tribunal concluded that SM alone could determine profit shares and thus sale proceeds, defeating MPHL’s claim to control. Expert concessions corroborated this. Partnership law authorities (Lindley & Banks) clarified that property used by a partnership is not necessarily partnership property, negating arguments that MPHL automatically bore risks through asset ownership. Clause 9 related only to legal goodwill, irrelevant to GAAP control analysis; therefore, MPHL did not retain substantive risks or rewards.\nThe Tribunal reasoned that once the partnership was formed, control over the care-home business rested with MCP and, specifically, its Managing Partner SM. Clauses 12.2 and 16.2 of the MCP Deed ensured that an outgoing partner’s departure would not dissolve the partnership or allow assets to be reclaimed. The mere ownership of property or the ability to disrupt operations did not amount to control under FRS 5.8, which defines control as the ability to obtain future economic benefits and restrict others’ access to them. MPHL therefore lacked control and could not recognise purchased goodwill under UK GAAP. The Tribunal accepted HMRC’s submission and held that MPHL’s reliance on termination rights and the familial relationship between MM and SM was misplaced when measured against the legal structure established by the MCP Deed.\nThe Tribunal accepted HMRC’s submission that Clause 9.1 is, on its natural and objective reading, a declaration of ownership of the asset (goodwill) and not a grant of entitlement to sale proceeds.  Even if interpreted as conferring such entitlement, the nature of the right (proprietary or contractual) would remain unclear because MPHL furnished no consideration.  Turning to Clause 14.2.1, the use of the term “accrue” was held to indicate a contingent debt obligation arising only upon dissolution and after satisfaction of liabilities, not a present ownership of proceeds.  The Tribunal found that the agreement’s flexibility—allowing the Managing Partner to amend provisions—meant MPHL lacked secured access to sale proceeds.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected arguments that textbook commentary and authorities supported the notion that a non-partner could own partnership goodwill.  The presumption that goodwill belongs to the firm is rebuttable, but nothing in the MCP Deed or factual matrix rebutted it here."

    "decision": {
        "conclusion": "Appeal dismissed – the accounts were not drawn up in accordance with GAAP and no corporation-tax deductions for purchased goodwill (or related group relief) are allowed.\nTribunal accepted HMRC’s position: the commercial substance was that the business was transferred to and controlled by MCP; MPHL did not retain control and could not recognise goodwill.\nTribunal rejected the appellants’ submission that MPL acted as MPHL’s agent; found that control and operations had passed to MCP and that MPHL did not retain significant benefits or risks within FRS 5.\nAppeals dismissed.",
        "reasoning_summary": "GAAP-compliant accounts would not have recognised goodwill (or would have recognised it only at a substantially lower value), so the claimed amortisation/impairment debits and consequent group relief must be denied.\nApplying FRS 5.14, the legal form (a clause reserving goodwill) could not override substance.  Operational authority, profit allocation rights and accounting treatment all indicated MCP as the controlling entity.\nNo agency agreement, accounting evidence, unfettered autonomy of MPL, and witness testimony showed absence of agency and control; under FRS 5.25 any rights retained by MPHL were not significant in practice.\nMPHL did not acquire control of the Milton Park care-home business and therefore could not recognise purchased goodwill. Control and economic benefits resided with the partnership (MCP) and its Managing Partner under the MCP Deed, failing the control test in FRS 5.8."
