        "detailed_facts": "- The appeals concern closure notices amending the Appellants’ corporation tax returns to deny deductions for amortisation of purchased goodwill and consequent group relief. The Second Appellant, Milton Park Limited (MPL), is a wholly owned subsidiary of the First Appellant, Milton Park Holdings Ltd (MPHL).\n- Central issue: whether MPHL’s accounts for the relevant periods were drawn up in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) for the purposes of Schedule 29 to the Finance Act 2002 (for periods ending before 1 April 2009) and Part 8 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009 (for periods ending on or after 1 April 2009), specifically whether it was GAAP-compliant for MPHL to recognise any goodwill in those accounts.\n- The valuation of goodwill, if GAAP permitted recognition, was agreed: the parties agreed that £173m was too high and that the correct amount would be £51.936m if goodwill recognition were GAAP-compliant.\n- Consequences agreed: If GAAP-compliant accounts would not have recognised any goodwill, then no amortisation/impairment should have been recognised; no debits are allowable to MPHL for corporation tax; MPL is not entitled to group relief for those debits. If goodwill would have been recognised under GAAP, the allowable debits would be based on the £51.936m goodwill amount and group relief would be reduced accordingly. If the Tribunal rejected HMRC’s primary case and considered there was impairment of previously recognised goodwill, it would issue a decision in principle with valuation to be agreed.\n- Preliminary issue: Appellants applied on 24 January 2024 to admit further witness statements of Janice Ash and Michael McInerney dated 15 January 2024. HMRC objected as late, citing Tribunal Directions (Direction 6) requiring service of witness statements by 29 November 2021. The Tribunal admitted the evidence as relevant, noting lateness was not a compelling reason for exclusion; weight would be a matter for submissions.\n- Burden of proof: It rests on the Appellants to show the Closure Notice conclusions are wrong, on the balance of probabilities.\n- Evidence: Extensive bundles were provided. Appellants relied on witness statements from Janice Ash (29 Nov 2021; 15 Jan 2024), Lesa McAnulty (26 Oct 2022), and Michael McInerney (29 Nov 2021; 15 Jan 2024; 1 Feb 2024). JA and MM gave evidence and were cross-examined; their evidence was largely accepted save where otherwise stated. LM was not cross-examined and her evidence gave limited assistance. \n- Expert evidence on GAAP: Appellants’ expert Peter Chidgey (reports 18 July 2022; 3 Oct 2022); HMRC’s expert Dr Elizabeth Alford (reports 18 July 2022; 3 Oct 2022; addendum 19 Jan 2023). A joint statement was produced on 5 Dec 2022. The Tribunal was satisfied both experts were qualified.\n- Findings of fact (context): The appeals relate to transactions and agreements involving MM and EM (and connected persons) concerning care home operations at Milton Park Hospital and Pathways Latham House in Bedfordshire. Similar transactions existed for two other partnerships (Kemble & Oakley Partnership; Brookdale Healthcare Partnership).\n- 2004: MM and EM executed a Deed of Partnership dated 1 August 2004 (the MPP Deed of Partnership) recording their partnership operating a care home business trading as “Milton Park”. The partnership (Milton Park Partnership, MPP) was deemed to commence on 1 August 2004; partners could draw monthly sums on account of profit share, subject to review with MM as Managing Partner having final decision; goodwill of the partnership jointly owned by MM and EM. Partnership returns were filed with HMRC; no enquiries were opened.\n- 2005: Brookdale Healthcare Limited (BHL), controlled by MM and EM, executed a Deed of Admission dated 1 January 2005 with MM and EM, admitting BHL as a partner in MPP from 1 January 2005 under the terms of the MPP Deed as varied. (Further terms continue beyond the provided extract.)\n- Additional background from witness evidence: MM and EM were sole directors and shareholders of the Appellants until a sale to Tracscare in July 2015. JA’s roles since early 2013 in MM/EM-owned entities and prior employment at Haslers (1987–2013) were set out. LM was COO for Brookdale Healthcare (2000–2015) and involved with Milton Park Hospital’s inception to sale.\n- A partnership trading under the style “Milton Park” (the Milton Park Partnership, MPP) was evidenced by a Deed of Partnership. Key provisions included: commencement deemed 1 August 2004 (clause 3.1); partners could draw monthly sums on account of profit share as may be agreed, with MM as Managing Partner having final decision on revisions (clause 8); goodwill jointly owned by MM and EM (clause 9).\n- Partnership returns were filed with HMRC in the name of the MPP. No HMRC enquiries were opened into those partnership returns.\n- On 1 January 2005, Brookdale Healthcare Limited (BHL), controlled by MM and EM, executed a Deed of Admission to MPP with MM and EM. From that date BHL became a partner in MPP subject to the MPP Deed as varied. BHL was to provide services of full-time and temporary personnel to MPP. Personnel would undertake supervisory and management duties, planning and decision-making, review of financial data and accounts, and sales and marketing for MPP as required, subject to availability. MM, as Managing Partner, reserved the right to review BHL’s administrative and management services and BHL agreed to implement any recommendations. Clause 8 was replaced so that monthly drawings on account of profit share were to be agreed by MM as Managing Partner. Clause 9 was replaced so that BHL had no rights to goodwill, Capital Account, benefit, assets, or property of the partnership.\n- BHL functioned as a central services company providing regulatory functions, IT, HR, sales and marketing, training, and accounting across the various partnership businesses and was always a partner in each partnership.\n- On 1 April 2005, BCSL (a company controlled by MM) executed a Deed of Admission to MPP with MM, EM, and BHL. It recited a Supply of Employees Agreement dated 1 March 2005 between MM, EM, and BCSL (document not in evidence). From 1 April 2005 BCSL became a partner. BCSL’s supply of employees to MPP commenced 1 April 2005 and would continue subject to termination per the deed. MPP agreed to procure all employee requirements (excluding its own executive offices and administrative staff) exclusively from BCSL unless BCSL could not meet requirements on reasonable notice. Clause 8 was replaced to provide that BCSL’s profit share equalled the cost of employee emoluments plus a 35% mark-up, subject to MM (as Managing Partner) agreeing the MPP’s overall profit level was sufficient. Clause 9 was replaced to exclude BCSL from any rights to goodwill, Capital Account, benefit, assets, or property of the partnership.\n- In July 2005 the Milton Park Hospital opened at The Lane, Wyboston, Bedfordshire MK44 3AS; the freehold was owned by MM and EM. The hospital was operated as a care home using the names “Brookdale” and “Brookdale Care”.\n- On 16 January 2006 the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) served an Improvement Notice on BHL as the registered person under the Care Standards Act 2000 in respect of Milton Park Hospital due to a staff member being injured by a disturbed patient. The notice was complied with, confirmed by a further HSE visit in April 2006; no further action was required.\n- In early 2007 MM and EM began discussions with Haslers (advisers) about restructuring their operating partnerships. The assets of each partnership were owned by MM and EM. Mr Martin Anderson of Haslers proposed that MPP and other partnerships be incorporated by MM and EM into limited companies.\n- A discussion paper dated 27 March 2007 recorded: (1) MPP operates the Milton Park Independent Hospital; current partners are MM, EM, BHL, and BCSL. (2) The goodwill and freehold property are owned by MM and EM; BHL and BCSL are profit-sharing corporate partners only; BCSL provides all staff at Milton Park for a profit share flexed to cover staff costs plus a 35% mark-up; structure implemented for VAT reasons. (3) Objectives: to ensure only small-company-level disclosure (abbreviated accounts) and to continue the VAT-efficient structure involving BCSL.\n- Proposed transactions: (1) Remove corporate partners from the partnership immediately prior to incorporation to ensure compliance with Section 162 TCGA 1992 (which refers to partnerships that do not include companies). (2) MM and EM to transfer the partnership business to a new company, Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL), under the s162 procedure; treatment of the freehold property was still under consideration. (3) Immediately after the s162 transaction, MPHL to enter arrangements with a newly incorporated subsidiary, Milton Park Limited (MPL), to operate the business under an annual licence (the proposed annual licence was not pursued). (4) MPL to enter into a partnership agreement with BCSL; the new Milton Park partnership to conduct day-to-day business, with annual profit shares to MPL and BCSL; a structure similar to that used for care homes operated by BHL.\n- Analysis in the paper: MPHL would have significant net assets (~£80m), low turnover (licence fees), and no employees; MPL would have minimal net assets, turnover equal to its partnership profit share (under £5.6m), and no employees; thus MPHL plus MPL would pass the “two out of three” small companies disclosure test. Partnership turnover (>£15m) would not be attributed to either partner or to MPHL for disclosure purposes. Both MPHL and MPL would be small companies for disclosure purposes. VAT position would remain unchanged.\n- The proposals were presented to MM and EM. MM confirmed in oral evidence that the proposed transactions accorded with his instructions to Haslers and that the transactions were as recorded in the Statement of Agreed Facts and Issues.\n- The “Brookdale” name and logos were registered as trademarks by BHL as of 24 May 2007; “Brookdale Care” was not registered. The Brookdale name had been used since the 1990s across the care home businesses.\n- On 10 August 2007, Milton Park Limited (MPL) was incorporated in the UK with MM as sole shareholder.\n- MM served notices of withdrawal dated 20 November 2007 on BHL and BCSL. For BHL: withdrawal under clause 8 of the BHL Deed of Admission effective 20 November 2007; MPP to continue with the “Continuing Partners” per the MPP Deed as varied by the BHL Deed. For BCSL: withdrawal under clause 7 of the BCSL Deed of Admission effective 20 November 2007; MPP to continue with the “Continuing Partners” per the MPP Deed as varied by the BCSL Deed.\n- Minutes of BCSL board meeting on 30 November 2007 recorded: BCSL’s membership of MPP to cease on or after 20 December 2007 reflecting the notice; consideration of continuing to provide specialist staffing services for Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL), described as intending to purchase and operate the business under the name Milton Care Partnership; proposal that BCSL would later be invited to join Milton Care Partnership with profit share calculated to provide a percentage uplift on employment costs; approvals given to continue providing specialist staffing to Milton Care Partnership.\n- Minutes of BHL board meeting on 30 November 2007 recorded: BHL’s membership of MPP to cease on or after 20 December 2007 reflecting the withdrawal notice (further text not included in this extract).\n- On 20 November 2007, admission was given to BCSL to the Milton Park Partnership (MPP) with effect from that date. The MPP was to continue with the “Continuing Partners” in accordance with the MPP Deed of Partnership as varied by the BCSL Deed of Admission.\n- Minutes of BCSL’s board meeting on 30 November 2007 recorded that: (a) BCSL’s membership of the MPP was to cease on or after 20 December 2007, reflecting a notice dated 20 November 2007 from MPP pursuant to Clause 7 of the Partnership Agreement dated 1 April 2005; (b) the board considered a proposal to continue to provide specialist staffing services for Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL), described as the incorporated body intending to purchase and operate the business under the name Milton Care Partnership; (c) it was proposed that BCSL would later be invited to join Milton Care Partnership and its profit share would provide a percentage uplift on employment costs incurred; and (d) the proposals were approved and BCSL would continue to provide specialist staffing services to Milton Care Partnership.\n- Minutes of BHL’s board meeting on 30 November 2007 recorded that: (a) BHL’s membership of the MPP was to cease on or after 20 December 2007, reflecting a notice dated 20 November 2007 from MPP pursuant to Clause 7 of the Partnership Agreement dated 1 April 2005; (b) the board considered a proposal to continue to provide specialist staffing services for MPHL; (c) it was proposed BHL would later be invited to join Milton Care Partnership and its profit share would be calculated to provide a percentage uplift on employment costs incurred; (d) it was agreed to approve the proposals and continue to provide specialist staffing services to Milton Care Partnership. MM explained in his first witness statement (para 59) that BHL did not provide employees and the minutes were incorrect because BHL provided administrative/support services to all the businesses; the profit-share proposal premised on employment costs was also incorrect for that reason.\n- MPP’s accounts for the period ended 28 December 2007 show BHL and BCSL became creditors of the partnership upon cessation of membership. There was no formal agreement covering how BCSL would be paid for staff it provided after ceasing to be a member; the same applied to BHL until the beginning of April 2008. No separate fee was paid to BCSL for the period between 21 December 2007 (when BCSL left MPP) and 3 January 2008 (when it joined MCP).\n- The share of profits allocated to BCSL and BHL covered the period from 1 April 2006 to 28 December 2007.\n- On 20 December 2007, MPHL was incorporated in Jersey. MM and EM, who were UK residents, were the sole shareholders and directors. MPHL registered a UK branch on 29 May 2009.\n- A deed titled “Transfer of Partnership Assets & Liabilities Agreement” dated 28 December 2007 was executed by MM, EM, and MPHL. Under it, MM and EM agreed to sell, and MPHL agreed to buy, the business of the MPP as a going concern and to assume liabilities on the Completion Date. Schedule 2 listed three freehold properties (Milton Park, Latham, Manor Farm at The Lane, Wyboston, MK44 3AS) valued at £9.74m; business goodwill valued at £173m; and all other assets including debtors valued at £858,525; creditors were listed at £9,517,207. In addition, MM and EM agreed to vest other assets used in the conduct of the business in MPHL. Management accounts were to be prepared as at the Completion Date. Consideration comprised the allotment of 10,000 £1 ordinary shares in MPHL (5,000 each to MM and EM on 28 December 2007) credited as fully paid, plus assumption of liabilities.\n- In addition to the above assets, various operational documents (care plans, medication records, advocacy files, mental health documentation, deprivation of liberty and risk assessments, pre-admissions assessments, daily logs, relatives’ and social worker contacts, funding records, money safekeeping records, placement review and accident records, health and safety files, operating policies and procedures, property maintenance/insurance documents, staff training records and rotas including attendance and holiday records) and medical assets, equipment, fixtures, and computer equipment (at net book value) were transferred to MPHL.\n- On 31 December 2007, MPHL acquired the entire shareholding of MPL from MM for no consideration.\n- MPHL board minutes dated 31 December 2007 recorded consideration and approval of documents relating to MPHL’s acquisition of the partnership assets and liabilities of the MPP care home business, and that MPL would be instructed to conduct the general day-to-day management and execution of the business with full autonomy.\n- MPL board minutes dated 31 December 2007 recorded: (a) approval of an arrangement with MPHL whereby MPL, on behalf of MPHL, would conduct the day-to-day management and execution of the care home business recently acquired by MPHL; (b) that MPHL had recently acquired the partnership assets and business of MPP pursuant to a Transfer of Partnership Assets Agreement stated in the minutes to be dated 23 December 2007 and made between MM, EM and MPHL; (c) confirmation that MPHL had instructed MPL to conduct the day-to-day management of the business with full autonomy; and (d) a resolution that MPL would seek to enter into partnership with others to carry on the business of the care home.\n- On 1 January 2008, MPL and SM executed the MCP Deed of Partnership, reciting that MPL and SM operated a care home business trading as Milton Care and setting out terms including: SM as Managing Partner; the partnership bank account being the Brookdale Care bank account at NatWest, Harrow Town Centre; the partnership was deemed commenced on 1 January 2008; partners could draw monthly sums on account of profit share as agreed by SM (subject to review by SM with final decision); goodwill of MCP owned solely by MPHL; Managing Partner’s right to withdraw a partner on one month’s written notice; partnership not dissolved on a partner’s departure unless only one continuing partner remained; and outgoing partners to surrender partnership property and confidential information at termination.\n- The 2008 accounts of MCP do not show any assets being contributed by partners. The Partners’ Current Accounts record a share of profit in respect of MPL, BCL and SM.\n- MM accepted that SM had autonomy and was the Managing Partner of MCP. JA accepted that SM had autonomy over the partnership.\n- On 3 January 2008, MPL, SM and BCSL executed the BCSL Deed of Admission to MCP, reciting: Effective Date 3 January 2008; Term 8 years; MPHL acquired the assets and liabilities of a partnership operating as Milton Park via a Transfer Agreement dated 28 December 2007 between MPHL, MM and EM; MPL and SM formed their own partnership on 1 January 2008; BCSL supplied personnel to the care home sector generally and to MPP under a Supply of Employees Agreement dated 1 April 2005 (stated to be between MM, EM and BCSL); MPL and SM wished to admit BCSL to MCP to continue supplying the services. The Deed provided that from 3 January 2008 BCSL was a partner in MCP, and MCP would engage BCSL to supply services (the supply by BCSL of employees to MCP).\n• JA accepted that SM had autonomy over the partnership.\n• 3 January 2008: Milton Park Limited (MPL), SM and Brookdale Care Services Limited (BCSL) executed a Deed of Admission for BCSL to join the Milton Care Partnership (MCP). Recitals included: Effective Date 3 January 2008; Term 8 years from that date; MPHL acquired the assets and liabilities of a partnership operating a care home business trading as Milton Park by a Transfer of Partnership Assets and Liabilities Agreement dated 28 December 2007 between MPHL, MM and EM; MPL and SM formed their own partnership by Deed of Partnership dated 1 January 2008; BCSL supplied personnel to the care home sector generally and to the MPP under a Supply of Employees Agreement dated 1 April 2005 (between MM, EM and BCSL); MPL and SM wished to admit BCSL to MCP to continue supplying services.\n• Key terms of the BCSL Deed of Admission: from 3 January 2008 BCSL was a partner in MCP; MCP engaged BCSL to supply employees in consideration of a profit share; supply commenced 3 January 2008 for eight years subject to termination; MCP would procure all requirements for engagement of employees (except its own executive offices and administrative staff) exclusively from BCSL, with ability to use other sources if BCSL could not fulfil requirements on reasonable notice; on disposal of MCP goodwill, SM as Managing Partner could withdraw BCSL from the partnership on 30 days’ written notice; Clause 8 of the MCP Deed of Partnership amended by new sub‑clause 8.4 so BCSL’s profit share equalled cost of employee emoluments plus 35% mark‑up, subject to SM (as Managing Partner) agreeing overall MCP profit was sufficient to satisfy the BCSL profit share; Clause 9 amended so goodwill of MCP continued to be owned by MPHL and BCSL agreed its admission afforded no rights to goodwill, capital account, benefit, assets or property of MCP; any consideration or compensation on disposal to an unconnected third party or change of control would belong only to MPL and SM (Existing Partners), and BCSL (New Partner) would not be entitled to any such amounts.\n• 4 April 2008: MPL, SM, BCSL and Brookdale Healthcare Limited (BHL) executed a Deed of Admission for BHL to join MCP. Recitals noted BHL supplied, on a non‑exclusive basis, administration support services to the care sector generally; MPL, SM and BCSL wished to admit BHL to MCP and continue to supply the services. Key terms: with effect from 4 April 2008 BHL was a partner in MCP with MPL, SM and BCSL; MCP to engage BHL to supply employees for a profit share; supply commenced 4 April 2008 for seven years subject to termination; MCP to procure all requirements for engagement of employees (except MCP’s own executive offices and administrative staff) exclusively from BHL, with ability to use other sources if BHL could not fulfil requirements on reasonable notice; on disposal of MCP goodwill, SM reserved right to withdraw BHL from the partnership on 30 days’ written notice; Clause 8 amended by new sub‑clause 8.4 so BHL’s profit share was equal to the residual profit following calculation of agreed profit sharing ratios, subject to SM agreeing MCP’s overall profit was sufficient to satisfy the BHL profit share; Clause 9 amended to confirm goodwill continued to be owned by MPHL; BHL agreed its admission afforded no rights to goodwill, capital account, benefit, assets or property of MCP; any consideration or compensation on disposal or change of control would belong only to MPL, SM and BCSL (Existing Partners), and BHL (New Partner) would not be entitled to such amounts.\n• May 2008: Following a patient incident, the Healthcare Commission conducted visits to Milton Park Hospital. On 12 May 2008, a statutory notice was served on BHL as the registered person under the Care Standards Act 2000. In September 2008, a report (addressed to BHL as the registered person and referring to the hospital as owned by BHL) concluded that actions taken addressed the issues, breaches had been remedied and notices were deemed complied with.\n• 2009–2010: The Care Quality Commission (CQC) undertook visits to Milton Park Hospital on various dates. The CQC report was addressed to BHL as the registered person and referred to the hospital as owned by BHL.\n• 31 March 2009 board minutes of MPHL: recorded that MPHL had appointed MPL to assume its role in the Milton Park Hospital business and resolved that MPHL would assume the role within the business previously undertaken by MPL with effect from 1 April 2009. Minutes recorded MPHL as the sole owner of the partnership goodwill of MCP by virtue of clause 9 of the Partnership Deed dated 1 January 2008 and that with effect from 1 April 2009 the Company would stand in the place of MPL and be responsible for the general day‑to‑day management and execution of the care home business.\n• 24 September 2009: MM and EM executed TR1 deeds effecting transfers of: Latham House, Wyboston (to MPHL); The Manor, The Lane, Wyboston (to MPHL); land and buildings to the south side of The Lane, Wyboston, now known as Milton Park (to MPHL); 10 Bushmead Road, Eaton Socon, St Neots, PE19 8BP (now Oakley House) (to Kemble Holdings Limited); and 23 Priory Villas, Colney Hatch Lane, London N11 3DB (to Kemble Holdings Limited). TR1s stated in the Consideration box: “Finance Act 2003 Schedule 15 Part 3 Incorporation of a Partnership Business to a Connected Company”.\n• 17 January 2013: A written resolution of the Partners of Milton Care Partnership resolved to formalise agreement following expiry of the agreement under which BCSL benefits from the company’s entitlement to its partnership share, agreeing that the arrangement shall continue until 30 days’ notice is served; that the partnership share shall be calculated as full salary costs incurred plus an addition between 0% and 35%; and that the addition is to be agreed annually between the partners. This was required as part of a refinancing process to release capital owed to MM and EM for a new care venture. Haslers advised, and bank solicitors highlighted that the BCSL partnership agreement dated 3 January 2008 had an expiration date (January 2016), before the end of the loan, and prepared paperwork to ensure the agreement extended at least throughout the funding period.\n• 7 July 2015: EM and MM sold their shares in MPHL to Tracscare, a third‑party UK care provider.\n• Operation of Milton Park Hospital (from opening in July 2005): the business operated from properties held by MM and EM with no rental charge (transferred to MPHL on 24 September 2009); BCSL provided staff to work at the hospital; BHL provided administrative and support staff; all end‑customer agreements and invoices used the “Brookdale” name and logo, which were registered trademarks of BHL.\n- A written resolution set that full salary costs would be incurred together with an addition to represent an increase on the salary costs of between zero percent and thirty-five percent, with the addition to be agreed annually between the partners. This written resolution was required as part of a refinancing process undertaken to release capital owed to MM and EM to enable them to progress with a new care venture. Haslers advised on the process and, through discussions with the bank’s solicitors, it was highlighted that the partnership agreement with BCSL dated 3 January 2008 had an expiration date in January 2016, effectively before the end of the term of the loan. The bank’s solicitors drew up paperwork to satisfy their clients that the agreement would at least extend throughout the funding period.\n- On 7 July 2015, EM and MM sold their shares in MPHL to Tracscare, a third-party UK care-provider.\n- Operation of Milton Park Hospital from its opening in July 2005:\n  (a) The business was operated from properties held by MM and EM with no rental charge; those properties were transferred from MM and EM’s ownership to MPHL on 24 September 2009.\n  (b) BCSL provided staff to work at Milton Park Hospital.\n  (c) BHL provided administrative and support staff for the business.\n  (d) All end-customer agreements and all invoices used the “Brookdale” name and logo, which were registered trademarks of BHL from 24 May 2007, and also carried the name “Brookdale Care”.\n  (e) All end-customer agreements and all invoices also carried the registered address of BHL (14 Parkway, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, ALB 6HG) and provided that payments should be made to the bank account of BHL.\n  (f) Marketing material identified the business as “Brookdale Care” with a single address (being BHL’s address referred to above), a single website, a single telephone number, and a single email address for all activities conducted.\n- Regulatory matters: BHL dealt with all regulatory matters. Under the Care Standards Act 2000 there had to be a registered manager and responsible individual and neither was required to be employed by the registered provider. BHL was registered as the registered provider as it carried on the central function entity on behalf of the business at Milton Park and the other care home partnerships. MM’s evidence was that this was done for administrative simplicity as having central functions in one place covering all four businesses/homes meant they could be controlled efficiently. MM viewed BHL as the group registration holder; this position was not questioned by the CQC.\n- MPHL’s financial statements:\n  • Period 28 December 2007 to 31 March 2009 (approved 11 January 2010): Recognised goodwill as an intangible fixed asset at a cost of £173m based on a Transfer of Partnership Assets & Liabilities Agreement dated 28 December 2007. On the date of incorporation the company issued 10,002 ordinary shares for £174,081,320 (nominal £10,002; share premium £174,071,318) as a result of the acquisition of the Milton Park Partnership on 28 December 2007. Goodwill amortised straight-line over 20 years; amortisation for the period £10,812,500 included within a loss on ordinary activities before tax of £9,663,568. No turnover recognised; administrative expenses £11,843,615 mainly amortisation (£10,812,500) and depreciation (£678,700). Only income was dividends of £2,180,047 from Milton Park Limited. Directors’ Report: MPHL acquired the business of Milton Park Partnership on 28 December 2007 and operates this through its subsidiary Milton Park Limited; it acts as a holding company. MM approved these accounts and was satisfied they gave a true and fair view.\n  • Period ended 31 March 2010: Recognised goodwill at £129,750,000 after an impairment charge of £32,437,500; impairment included within a loss before tax of £32,408,270.\n  • Period ended 31 March 2011: Recognised goodwill at £122,541,667 after amortisation £7,208,333; amortisation included within a loss before tax of £7,519,967.\n  • Period ended 31 March 2012: Recognised goodwill at £115,333,334 after amortisation £7,208,333; amortisation included within a loss before tax of £6,814,733.\n  • Period ended 31 March 2013: Recognised goodwill at £108,125,001 after amortisation £7,208,333; amortisation included within a loss before tax of £6,911,957.\n  • Period ended 31 March 2014: Recognised goodwill at £100,916,668 after amortisation £7,208,333; amortisation included within a loss before tax of £7,391,805.\n  • Period ended 31 March 2015: Recognised goodwill at £93,708,335 after amortisation £7,208,333; amortisation included within a loss before tax of £6,827,433.\n  • Period ended 31 March 2016: Accounts stated a prior period material error identified following change of ownership; carrying value of goodwill and investments as at 31 March 2015 was overstated as impairment in previous financial years had not been recognised. Goodwill recognised at £51,936,412; goodwill amortised straight-line over 10 years; amortisation for the period £5,193,641 included in a loss for the financial year of £4,561,931.\n  • Period ended 31 March 2017: Accounts stated an administrative error led to misstatement of goodwill cost and accumulated amortisation in the prior period note; correction offset in accumulated amortisation, so no P&L or net assets effect. Goodwill cost recognised at £140,562,500; amortisation for the period £5,193,641 included in a loss for the financial year of £3,727,210.\n  • Subsequent periods 2010–2015: Nil or nominal turnover recognised; administrative expenses mainly comprised amortisation and depreciation. Directors’ Report for period ended 31 March 2010 stated MPHL acquired the business of Milton Park Partnership on 28 December 2007 and operates this as a trading entity.\n- MPL’s financial statements: MPL reported net assets of £1 in all periods from 2008 to 2012 inclusive. In its abbreviated accounts for the period ended 31 March 2008, MPL recorded an investment in the Milton Care Partnership costing £nil, with carrying value increasing to reflect MPL’s profit share of £2.1m for the three months from commencement. Notes stated turnover comprises the profit share the company receives from the partnership it holds as an investment, and the fixed asset investment represents the current account of Milton Park Limited in the trading partnership of Milton Care Partnership.\n- Tax consequences claimed: For each of its accounting periods from 2008 to 2017, MPHL took goodwill amortisation/impairment into account when computing its corporation tax profit/loss. For its accounting period ended 31 March 2009, MPL made a trading profit of £932,358 and claimed group relief equal to the full amount based on the corporation tax loss computed by MPHL as a result of its goodwill amortisation.\n- HMRC enquiries and conclusions:\n  • On 18 January 2010 and 5 January 2010 respectively, personal tax enquiries were opened into the self-assessment tax returns of MM and EM for the year ended 5 April 2008. For capital gains purposes MM and EM were treated as having disposed of the business of the MPP during that year with no gains arising due to s162 TCGA 1992. The enquiries were closed without adjustment.\n  • On 11 October 2010, HMRC opened an enquiry into MPL’s corporation tax return for the accounting period ended 31 March 2009.\n  • On 16 December 2010, HMRC opened enquiries into MPHL’s corporation tax returns for accounting periods ended 27 December 2008 and 31 March 2009 and into MPL’s return for the accounting period ended 31 March 2009.\n  • Between 2011 and 2018, HMRC opened enquiries into MPHL’s corporation tax returns for all periods from 2010 to 2017.\n  • On 8 March 2019, HMRC closed those enquiries. For MPHL, HMRC concluded amendments disallowing goodwill amortisation as follows: 27/12/2008 (£8,609,028; tax due £0.00 – losses reduced); 31/03/2009 (£2,203,472; tax due £0.00 – losses reduced); 31/03/2010 (£32,437,500; tax due £76,083.84); 31/03/2011 (£7,208,333; tax due £0.00 – losses reduced); 31/03/2012 (£7,208,333; tax due £57,231.20); 31/03/2013 (£7,208,333; tax due £101,769.12); 31/03/2104 (£7,208,333; tax due £0.00 – losses reduced); 31/03/2015 (£7,208,333; tax due £121,545.90); 31/03/2016 (£7,208,333; tax due £0.00 – losses reduced); 31/03/2017 (£2,364,032; tax due £78,764.80).\n  • For MPL’s accounting period ended 31/03/2009, HMRC concluded a reduction of losses available to claim through group relief of £738,927 as a result of the disallowance of goodwill amortisation in MPHL’s accounts, with tax due of £206,899.56.\n  • These conclusions were upheld by HMRC on review, notified to the Appellants by letter dated 15 July 2019.\n- Competing goodwill valuations were discussed for MPHL’s 2009 acquisition accounting: a goodwill figure of £174.59 million (earlier valuation) which would have meant goodwill was understated by £1.59 million in the 2009 accounts; and a later agreed valuation of £51.94 million which would have meant goodwill was overstated by £121.06 million.\n- If the lower, later valuation (£51.94 million) is accepted, and assuming no derecognition or impairment was required, MPHL’s goodwill and amortisation in the accounts from 2009 to 2017 were overstated. Specifically, amortisation was overstated by £60.46 million (subject to assumptions about disallowance in 2016 and 2017), rendering those accounts not GAAP-compliant.\n- Dr Alford notes that if MPHL acquired the business but quickly transferred operations to MPL, it should have derecognised all or part of the goodwill under FRS 5. She lacks sufficient information to quantify any derecognition or any impairment that might have been required under FRS 10.\n- Dr Alford’s supplementary report dated 3 October 2022 responds to two questions arising from Mr Chidgey’s expert report:\n  • Question 1 (Care Standards Act 2000 registration): Dr Alford reiterates that it is for the Tribunal to determine whether MPHL acquired the business and gained control over the net assets and operations of the Milton Park hospital, and whether BHL’s continued involvement precluded a business transfer or prevented MPHL from operating as a care home. She states she has seen no evidence contradicting Mr Chidgey’s assertions that BHL’s continued service provision was not an impediment to a business transfer and that the arrangements did not prevent MPHL from operating as a care home.\n  • Question 2 (hypothetical regulatory requirement): Applying GAAP to a hypothetical scenario where MPHL would have been required to register to operate the hospital (with failure being a criminal offence and exposing MPHL to potential injunctive relief by the Healthcare Commission), Dr Alford maintains that the Tribunal must determine whether MPHL acquired the business. If the Tribunal finds that MPHL did acquire the business, the transaction met the definition of a business combination (but not a merger) under FRS 6, and it was GAAP-compliant for MPHL to account for the transaction as a business acquisition and to recognise goodwill—either £174.59 million or £51.94 million, depending on the valuation accepted. Conversely, if MPHL did not acquire a business, then recognition of goodwill was not GAAP-compliant, and the accounts from 2009 to 2017 would not comply with GAAP.\n- Dr Alford explains that the hypothetical regulatory requirement could influence the Tribunal’s factual determination: if the registration requirement prevented MPHL from acquiring or operating the business, then MPHL should not have accounted for the transaction as a business acquisition or recognised goodwill. She notes under FRSSE 2.2 and FRS 5.14 that even illegal transactions must be accounted for if they give rise to new assets or liabilities; thus, the substance of the transaction determines the accounting treatment.\n- Dr Alford opines the hypothetical scenario does not, in itself, present a barrier to MPHL or MCP acquiring and operating the business. If the Tribunal agrees, her original conclusions remain. If the Tribunal finds that the registration requirement prevented MPHL from acquiring the business (and likewise, if it prevented MCP), then treating the transaction as a business acquisition or recognising goodwill would not be GAAP-compliant.\n- On reflecting the hypothetical regulatory risk in the accounts: (i) if MPHL or MCP acquired the business, potential regulatory consequences should have been considered when valuing goodwill; (ii) any liabilities arising from regulatory action for failure to register would relate to the predecessor (MPP), not MPHL, and would affect the net assets acquired; (iii) such liabilities would reduce the net assets acquired, thereby increasing the amount of goodwill recognised and the associated amortisation; and (iv) any regulatory action against MPHL or MCP would be a post-acquisition event and would not affect the initial accounting treatment. Dr Alford cannot quantify potential liabilities or impairments, but any such adjustments would affect the goodwill calculation and increase the amortisation charge in MPHL’s accounts.\nHMRC examined the corporation tax treatment of goodwill amortisation in the returns of Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL) for accounting periods ended 27 December 2008 and 31 March 2009, and Milton Park Limited (MPL) for the accounting period ended 31 March 2009. Between 2011 and 2018, HMRC opened enquiries into MPHL’s corporation tax returns for all periods from 2010 to 2017. On 8 March 2019, HMRC closed those enquiries and concluded amendments disallowing goodwill amortisation across multiple years for MPHL, with associated tax consequences, and a related amendment to MPL’s 2009 return reducing group relief losses due to the goodwill amortisation disallowance reflected in MPHL’s accounts.\n\nFor MPHL, HMRC concluded the following amendments on closing the enquiries (8 March 2019):\n- Accounting period ended 27/12/2008: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £8,609,028; tax due £0.00 (losses reduced).\n- Accounting period ended 31/03/2009: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £2,203,472; tax due £0.00 (losses reduced).\n- Accounting period ended 31/03/2010: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £32,437,500; tax due £76,083.84.\n- Accounting period ended 31/03/2011: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £7,208,333; tax due £0.00 (losses reduced).\n- Accounting period ended 31/03/2012: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £7,208,333; tax due £57,231.20.\n- Accounting period ended 31/03/2013: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £7,208,333; tax due £101,769.12.\n- Accounting period ended 31/03/2104: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £7,208,333; tax due £0.00 (losses reduced).\n- Accounting period ended 31/03/2015: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £7,208,333; tax due £121,545.90.\n- Accounting period ended 31/03/2016: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £7,208,333; tax due £0.00 (losses reduced).\n- Accounting period ended 31/03/2017: Disallowance of goodwill amortisation of £2,364,032; tax due £78,764.80.\n\nFor MPL, HMRC concluded for the accounting period ended 31/03/2009: Reduction of losses available to claim through group relief by £738,927 as a result of disallowance of goodwill amortisation (as shown in MPHL’s accounts); tax due £206,899.56.\n\nHMRC’s conclusions were upheld on review and notified by letter dated 15 July 2019 to the Appellants.\n\nExpert accounting evidence was adduced. PC (Mr Chidgey) provided expert reports dated 18 July 2022 and 3 October 2022. He opined that MPHL acquired a business under UK GAAP (an integrated set of assets, inputs, processes, and outputs), assumed the principal risks and rewards, and retained control over future economic benefits, so subsequent operation via MPL did not trigger derecognition of goodwill; depreciation should be charged in MPHL while MPL received a profit share. He rejected the view that MCP, rather than MPHL, acquired the operations, arguing MPHL controlled the benefits and could revoke MPL’s mandate, which it did on 31 March 2009.\n\nAE (Dr Alford) provided expert reports dated 18 July 2022 and 30 October 2022, and a supplementary report dated 3 October 2022. She addressed GAAP compliance: whether MPHL’s transaction under the Transfer of Partnership Assets & Liabilities Agreement (28 December 2007) could be accounted for as an acquisition of a business and whether MPHL could recognise goodwill. Applying FRS 6, she considered the transaction was not a merger and distinguished two interpretations: (1) MPHL acquired operations and transferred them to MPL, or (2) MCP took control of operations. She favoured option (2), concluding MPHL did not acquire a business; thus, it would not be GAAP-compliant to account as a business acquisition or to recognise goodwill. Alternatively, if MPHL did acquire a business (option (1)), it could be GAAP-compliant to treat it as a business acquisition. On goodwill, she set out two alternative valuations if a business was acquired: £174.59m (based on the Transfer Agreement, adjusted for Manor Farm), implying goodwill was understated by £1.59m in 2009; or £51.94m (based on a later agreed valuation), implying goodwill was overstated by £121.06m. She stated amortisation was overstated by £60.46m (subject to assumptions on disallowance in 2016 and 2017) if the latter valuation applied. She also noted that if operations were quickly transferred to MPL, FRS 5 might require derecognition of goodwill, but she lacked information to quantify derecognition or any impairment under FRS 10. In her supplementary report, responding to questions (including on registration under the Care Standards Act 2000 and whether arrangements prevented MPHL from operating as a care home), she reiterated that it is for the Tribunal to determine whether MPHL acquired the business and gained control over the net assets.\n- Central issue: Whether MPHL’s accounts were prepared in accordance with GAAP concerning recognition of purchased goodwill after acquiring the MPP care home business and whether any subsequent derecognition was required.\n- Pre-acquisition: The MPP business was operated by a partnership comprising MM and EM, with BHL providing administrative services and BCSL supplying staff.\n- December 2007: MPHL was incorporated and entered a Transfer Agreement with MM and EM to acquire the MPP business and its assets, including goodwill valued at £173 million.\n- Subsequent structure: MPHL acquired MPL. MPL then entered into a new partnership, MCP, initially with SM and later with BHL and BCSL. MPHL’s accounts recognised and amortised goodwill, leading to tax deductions and group relief claims. MPHL retained ownership of business assets; MCP acted as the vehicle to manage operations.\n- Control assertions (Appellants): Clause 9 of the MCP Deed of Partnership stated that goodwill belonged to MPHL; MPHL could revoke MPL’s management arrangement and did so after about 15 months. Board minutes dated 31 December 2007 recorded that MPL was instructed to manage the business for MPHL.\n- Appellants’ position: Recognition of goodwill was correct under UK GAAP (FRS 5, 6, 10, 11; with advisory references to IFRS 3 and FRED 36). MPHL obtained and retained control, risks, and rewards; derecognition was not required. HMRC had previously accepted for s162 TCGA 1992 that a business was acquired.\n- HMRC’s position: MPHL did not acquire a business for accounting purposes and should not have recognised purchased goodwill. Alternatively, delegation to MPL and the MCP formation required derecognition of goodwill (full or partial) under FRS 5.\n- HMRC’s detail: MPHL may have acquired control of net assets (including freeholds) but not of operations, which MCP conducted (staffing, administration, customer contracts, marketing) and where risks and rewards lay. MPHL’s accounts did not record turnover; MPHL received dividends from MPL, sourced from MCP profits, evidencing lack of operational control.\n- Valuation dispute: If a business was acquired, HMRC says goodwill should be £51.936m, not £173m, reducing amortisation deductions and group relief.\n- Experts: Appellants’ expert PC referenced IFRS 3 for “business”; HMRC says UK GAAP (FRSSE, FRS 5) governs. HMRC’s expert EA said transfer of operational control would require partial/fully derecognising goodwill under FRS 5.\n- Common ground on GAAP applicability and definitions: FRSSE applied for MPHL’s 2009 accounts; FRSSE (effective April 2008) applied 2010–2015; FRS 102 applied 2016–2017. Agreed definitions: purchased goodwill (FRSSE Chapter C); fair value under FRSSE; acquisition and business combination under FRS 6; scope of FRS 6; control of another entity (FRS 5.8); control in the context of an asset (FRS 5.3).\nThis section addresses the applicable accounting framework and definitions relevant to whether the transactions in issue amounted to a business combination and whether control was obtained, for accounting purposes. The tribunal sets out definitions from UK GAAP (FRSSE, FRS 5, and FRS 6) concerning purchased goodwill, fair value, acquisition, business combination, and control (both of an entity and of an asset). The Appellants’ expert (PC) approached the analysis by reference to international standards (IFRS 3 and FRED 36), asserting that, because FRSSE allows reference to other standards where it does not specifically address a transaction, IFRS 3/FRED 36 could supply the definition of “business” as an integrated set of activities and assets capable of generating returns. In cross‑examination, PC accepted that “other accounting standards” in FRSSE refers to UK SSAPs and FRSs and UITF abstracts (UK sources), that IFRS 3 and FRED 36 were not in force at the relevant time, and that FRS 6 remained the applicable standard until superseded in 2015; where a FRED conflicts with an extant standard, the latter prevails. He also accepted that IFRS 3 and FRED 36 exclude combinations under common control (as here, involving MPP and MPHL), that the “Basis for Conclusions” does not form part of the standards, and that international standards are advisory rather than mandatory sources of GAAP when UK standards address the issue. The tribunal agrees with HMRC that there was no need to import an IFRS definition of “business”; FRS 6 defines a business combination by reference to obtaining control over the net assets and operations of another entity.\n\nTurning to the core question under FRS 6, the parties agreed that a merger was not in issue, and that the essential question was whether MPHL obtained control over both the net assets and the operations of MPP as a result of the transactions. Definitions of “control” from FRS 5 and the ASB Statement of Principles (SOP) are set out, emphasising the ability to direct financial and operating policies with a view to economic benefit, the distinction between control and management, the linkage of access to benefits with bearing risks, and the two aspects of control: deployment of resources and ability to benefit/suffer from that deployment. \n\nAs to control over net assets, HMRC’s expert (EA) opined (subject to assumptions that the Transfer Agreement was executed as written and witness statements of MM and JA were complete as to facts) that MPHL gained control over: (a) the freehold properties from MM and EM (except Manor Farm); and (b) separately, the net assets of MPP (except cash balances and certain tax-related amounts payable/recoverable by MM and EM under the Transfer Agreement). HMRC accepted in their skeleton that control over net assets of MPP appears to be met in favour of MPHL, subject to a substance‑over‑form assessment. HMRC did not challenge the execution of the Transfer Agreement or completeness of the witness statements in cross‑examination. \n\nOn substance over form, both parties agreed that the transactions must be accounted for by their commercial substance. FRSSE 2.2 and FRS 5.14 are quoted, requiring identification of new or changed assets/liabilities and viewing a group or series of transactions that achieves an overall commercial effect as a whole. PC’s position was that, looked at in substance, MPHL acquired a functioning care home business and retained the risks and rewards of that business, despite the later formation of MCP and involvement of other partners. Both experts agreed that the arrangements must be analysed as a whole to determine which party has access to the risks and rewards, so as to decide which steps in a series of transactions are relevant to determining whether assets or liabilities should be recognised by MPHL.\nThe case concerns a series of transactions designed to move a care home business from MPP (the former partnership) via MPHL to MCP (the new partnership). Both parties relied on accounting standards (FRSSE 2.2 and FRS 5.14) requiring assessment of the substance of transactions and to view a series of transactions that achieve an overall commercial effect as a whole. EA (for HMRC) and PC (for the Appellants) agreed that the arrangements must be analysed as a whole to determine which party has access to the risks and rewards, as this determines whether assets or liabilities may be recognised. HMRC argued that most of the main transactions took place over about five days and that, in substance, the business moved from MPP to MCP, with no practical change on the ground other than governance and accounting moving to MCP. A discussion paper dated 27 March 2007 set out the purpose of the transactions. MM and JA accepted in cross-examination that the purpose was to move the business from MPP to MCP. The Tribunal agreed that the overall commercial effect was the transfer of the business. Under FRS 5.14, the Tribunal must assess commercial substance, giving greater weight to aspects with practical effect. The MCP Deed of Partnership provided that the partners (MPL and SM) would carry on the business of a care home for their mutual benefit, and identified SM as Managing Partner with control over profit allocation and operational decisions. Clause 2.1 stated the partners shall carry on the business of a care home for their mutual benefit. The Deed recited that the partners operate a care home business under the name Milton Care. Cross-examination of MM and PC confirmed that MCP was operating the care home business for the partners, not managing it for someone else. The Appellants relied on Clause 9 of the MCP Deed purporting to reserve goodwill to MPHL and argued that MPHL retained the income and capital value of the business; Mr Sykes submitted that this clause should be construed purposively to preserve MPHL’s economic interest. HMRC contended that FRS 5.14 requires objective assessment of commercial effect, not retrospective intention; control over operations and economic benefits passed to MCP and SM. MCP’s financial statements recorded all turnover and operating expenses; MPHL’s accounts recorded no trading income and described MPHL as a holding company. The Partners’ Certificate for MCP’s accounts to 31 March 2008 was signed by MPL, BCSL and SM, approving a profit of £2,542,132. The Accountants’ Report referred to an engagement letter dated 28 January 2009 and confirmed compilation of MCP’s trading and profit and loss account, balance sheet and notes from the accounting records and information provided by the partners. The Tribunal concluded that legal declarations of ownership (such as a clause reserving legal goodwill to MPHL) cannot override the objective GAAP assessment of control and that MCP and its Managing Partner had the ability to direct the financial and operating policies to obtain economic benefits. Accordingly, MPHL did not acquire or retain control or the goodwill for accounting recognition, and the operations passed to MCP.\nThe tribunal considered whether Milton Care Partnership (MCP) operated the care home business, or whether it was merely managed on behalf of Milton Park Holdings Limited (MPHL) by Milton Park Limited (MPL) acting as MPHL’s agent. The MCP Deed of Partnership was accepted by all parties as reflecting the parties’ agreement; no suggestion of sham was made by HMRC. The tribunal found that MCP was operating the business, supported by MCP’s accounts for the period ended 31 March 2008, which recorded all turnover from the care home business and related operating expenses. A Partners’ Certificate in those accounts was signed by MPL, BCSL and SM, approving the accounts and acknowledging responsibility for them. The Accountants’ Report noted compilation of MCP’s trading and profit and loss account, balance sheet and notes based on records and explanations provided, with the partners approving the information and acknowledging responsibility.\n\nIn cross-examination, MM accepted that MCP’s accounts gave a true and fair view and that he had signed them, explaining reliance on Haslers and trust that the accounts gave a true and fair view. The tribunal noted that MCP’s accounts recorded turnover and cost of sales related to running a care home and did not show MCP receiving a management fee, salary, commission, or other remuneration that would be expected if MCP was merely acting as a manager. Expert EA (Dr Alford), in a Joint Statement (JS), attached weight to the accounting treatment—MCP reporting the business turnover rather than MPHL—interpreting under SoP 2.6 that MCP, not MPHL, exercised control over profits, losses, assets, and liabilities. EA also noted MPHL’s instruction to MPL gave MPL full autonomy over conduct of the business and that MPL subsequently formed MCP with Sean McInerney (SM) to conduct the business, with SM having final say on profit sharing arrangements.\n\nPC, in cross-examination, suggested MCP’s accounts were not necessarily inconsistent with MPHL having control, but the tribunal found this difficult to reconcile with the substance: MPHL did not recognise any turnover or costs of a business which on the Appellants’ case it wholly owned and controlled. The tribunal considered this inconsistent with SoP 2.6 and not a true and fair view. PC argued that who accounts for turnover is less important than where profit goes, and suggested MCP’s accounts reflected profits and losses of the limited business instructed to carry on day-to-day operations; the tribunal rejected this view as inconsistent with the substance and accounting principles.\n\nHMRC pointed to the use of BHL trademarks and BHL’s address on marketing, customer agreements, and invoices, with payments to BHL’s bank account, and that BHL (not MPHL) was the registered person under the Care Standards Act 2000 and recipient of statutory notices. The tribunal did not regard these points as determinative on whether MCP operated or managed the care home, accepting evidence that the CQC had no objection to BHL being the registered person and that common brand use across group entities was typical. What the tribunal considered determinative was that BHL and BCSL were admitted as partners of MCP, and MCP (through managing partner SM) had control over staff and administrative services supplied by BHL and BCSL. The agreed facts recorded that MCP controlled the staff.\n\nOn the contention that MPL acted as agent for MPHL, reliance was placed by the Appellants on MPL board minutes dated 31 December 2007 stating that \"on behalf of MPHL, the Company will conduct the day to day management and execution of a care home business recently acquired by MPHL.\" PC opined MPL was an undisclosed agent of MPHL and that, under FRS 5 (Application Note G), an agent should not include in its turnover amounts payable to the principal; on this view, MPHL should have accounted for the profit share rather than MPL. However, minutes of the MPHL board meeting of the same date did not record any appointment of MPL as MPHL’s agent, which the tribunal would have expected if such an appointment existed. HMRC referred to Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency (23rd edn) for the definition of agency, and submitted there was no express or implied manifestation of assent establishing such a relationship; HMRC also highlighted the absence of proposed remuneration or commission for MPL and other factors pointing away from agency (further listed beyond this excerpt).\nThis section addresses whether MPHL retained significant benefits and risks, or control over profits and sale proceeds of the care home business, after the formation of the Milton Care Partnership (MCP). The Appellants relied on FRS 5.25 to argue MPHL retained principal risks and benefits (including residual profits and sale proceeds), supported by expert PC. HMRC, via AE, contended that any rights cited by the Appellants were contingent, practically unenforceable, or subject to others’ discretion (notably the MCP Managing Partner), and thus not significant in practice under FRS 5.25 and did not amount to control under FRS 5.8. The Tribunal accepted HMRC’s position, finding the rights relied upon (e.g., the ability to terminate arrangements with MPL, ownership of real property, and purported entitlement to goodwill) were contingent or subject to discretion and did not enable MPHL to direct MCP’s financial and operating policies. The real property was not a partnership asset and could be replaced or substituted, so ownership did not confer business control. The MCP Deed of Partnership vested control over profit allocation and access to sale proceeds in the Managing Partner, SM, not MPHL. Clause 14.2.3 provided that any surplus on dissolution/sale would be paid rateably to partners in the proportions in which they shared profits immediately prior to dissolution; Clause 8.2 gave the Managing Partner authority to review and, in the absence of agreement, decide partners’ profit shares each accounting period. Evidence from MM and JA confirmed SM’s autonomy in determining profit shares. Minutes of MCP meetings showed profit allocations were decided by MCP, with SM directing allocations; one minute referenced discussion and direction from M McInerney but did not displace the Deed’s allocation of decision-making power to SM. The Tribunal rejected MM’s claim of an undocumented “informal family understanding” about profit allocation/control, finding no evidence of it and holding that informal expectations cannot override GAAP’s substance-over-form assessment based on legal documentation and actual conduct. HMRC further argued that even if MM exerted de facto familial control, that would be MM’s personal control over the wider corporate structure (MPHL, BHL, BCSL), not control by MPHL. On profits from income, PC had attributed at least 90% of residual profits to MPHL based on how SM exercised allocation in practice, but under cross-examination PC accepted that for GAAP the determinative issue is who has the authority to control future economic benefits; the Tribunal found that authority rested solely with SM as Managing Partner under the MCP Deed, not with MPHL.\nThis segment addresses whether MPL acted as agent for MPHL and who retained the risks and rewards of the care home business following restructuring. HMRC argued no agency existed between MPL and MPHL, relying on: (1) no remuneration/commission for MPL; (2) no apparent benefit to MPHL; (3) no limitations on MPL’s discretion; (4) accounting treatment showing MPL recorded turnover from MCP while MPHL recorded only income from investments; and (5) the MPHL–MPL relationship being better explained as parent and wholly-owned subsidiary rather than principal and agent. The Tribunal noted MPHL Board minutes of 31 December 2007 contained no reference to MPL being appointed as or acting as MPHL’s agent and agreed with HMRC. Expert PC had posited it was arguable MPL acted as management agent for MPHL and that under FRS 5 Application Note G an agent should not include in turnover amounts payable to the principal; he suggested MPHL should have accounted for the profit share directly. The Tribunal considered PC’s view of the accounting treatment, but found it supported HMRC’s case that there was no agency. Oral evidence from MM indicated MPL was a subsidiary used to channel profits up to MPHL due to concerns about public domain information; JA’s evidence was consistent. The Tribunal held that even if MPL were agent, that would not establish MPHL’s control for GAAP purposes; FRS 5.8 requires ability to direct financial and operating policies to obtain economic benefits, which MPHL did not have. The Tribunal concluded the operations of MPL passed to MCP. On risks and rewards, PC (for the Appellants) argued MPHL acquired control over principal risks and rewards via the Transfer of Partnership Assets & Liabilities, retaining rights to sale proceeds and profits, controlling admission deeds to withdraw partners on a sale, and access to at least 90% of residual profits; he argued MPHL would bear losses in a downturn and that MCP functioned to procure inputs, not transfer benefits, with partners remunerated for inputs (e.g., Sean McInerney at £5,000/year). EA opined that analysis must consider arrangements as a whole and access to future profits; she highlighted that Sean McInerney, as Managing Partner and only Non‑Corporate Partner, determined profit allocations; corporate partners (MPL, BCSL, BHL) had no voting rights; MPL had full autonomy over operations; MPHL was not a corporate partner at acquisition and had only indirect influence via its shareholding in MPL; while MPHL bore property losses, that did not determine who assumed business risks/rewards. HMRC contended that Appellants’ reliance on FRS 5.25 was misplaced: the relevant inquiry is whether rights are significant in practice, and the rights relied on were contingent, not practically enforceable, or subject to the Managing Partner’s discretion; termination or withdrawal of property would not amount to control per FRS 5.8. The Tribunal accepted HMRC’s submissions and found MPHL’s retained rights were not significant within FRS 5.25, which focuses on benefits/risks likely to occur in practice.\nThis section addresses whether MPHL, rather than MCP (a partnership) and its Managing Partner (SM), retained control over the operations and economic benefits (risks and rewards) of the care home business for GAAP/FRS 5 purposes. HMRC argued that GAAP focuses on where authority to control economic benefits resides, not on how profits were actually distributed. Under cross-examination, the Appellants’ expert (PC) accepted that the actual allocation of profits is not determinative for GAAP; the relevant question is who has the power to determine distribution of future economic benefits. The Tribunal found that control over profits and operations lay with SM, the Managing Partner of MCP, under the MCP Deed of Partnership, not with MPHL. The Appellants suggested there must have been a prior agreement ensuring MPHL’s entitlement to profits given an intended sale; the Tribunal held that GAAP requires an objective analysis of control, and the absence of any formal agreement securing MPHL’s entitlement reinforces that MPHL did not retain control.\n\nOn access to sale proceeds, HMRC submitted that while access was tightly controlled, the key was that the control lay with SM per the MCP Deed. Clause 14 (Dissolution) provided that on dissolution, proceeds are applied to liabilities and any deficiency contributed in the same proportions as profits immediately prior to dissolution, and that any sum from disposal of business goodwill accrues solely to MPHL. Clause 8.2 provided that the Managing Partner (SM) has the power to determine each partner’s profit share. It was accepted by MM and PC that SM, not MPHL, controlled access to any proceeds of a future sale of the business.\n\nRegarding losses, PC argued MPHL’s property assets would ultimately bear losses since MPHL held the fixed assets. HMRC responded that although MPHL owned the real property used by the business, those assets were not necessarily partnership property (relying on the accepted legal distinction, including Lindley & Banks). The Tribunal accepted that distinction and recorded PC’s concession that losses would be borne by the partners, not by MPHL’s property assets, so MPHL’s ownership of fixed assets did not show it bore the business’s risks and rewards.\n\nOn goodwill, Clause 9 of the MCP Deed stated the goodwill of the partnership is owned by MPHL, and admission deeds for BCSL (1 April 2005) and BHL (1 January 2005) amended Clause 9 to confirm goodwill remained with MPHL and that the new partner(s) had no entitlement to goodwill or certain sale-related consideration, which would belong to the existing partners (MPL and Sean). The Appellants argued this showed MPHL retained rewards. HMRC argued Clause 9 concerns legal goodwill, not accounting (purchased) goodwill under GAAP. Mr Sykes ultimately accepted in oral submissions that Clause 9 refers to legal goodwill. The Tribunal held it agreed with HMRC and did not accept the Appellants’ submissions, noting that GAAP focuses on accounting concepts and control of economic benefits, and that the clauses addressed legal goodwill and contractual allocations rather than GAAP control.\n\nAuthorities and texts cited in this section include FRS 5 (para 8), GAAP principles, Lindley & Banks on Partnerships, Chitty on Contracts (\"saving the document\" principle), and case law such as Hopton v Miller [2010] EWHC 2232 (Ch); Miles v Clarke [1953] 1 WLR 537; Stekel v Ellice [1973] 1 WLR 191; Bhayani v Taylor Bracewell LLP [2016] EWHC 3360 (IPEC); and Castledine v RSM Bentley Jennison [2011] EWHC 2363 (Ch).\nThe tribunal considered arguments regarding the meaning, ownership, and value of “goodwill” referenced in Clauses 9 and 14 of the MCP Deed of Partnership, and whether any proceeds attributable to goodwill should belong to MPHL. During oral submissions, Mr Sykes accepted that the reference to goodwill in Clause 9 could only be to legal goodwill, not accounting goodwill, acknowledging that the deed addressed legal goodwill even though the broader dispute concerned recognition of accounting goodwill. Mr Sykes submitted that the declaration of goodwill was intended to have commercial effect, ensuring proceeds attributable to goodwill go to MPHL; he relied on the construction principle (cited from Chitty on Contracts (35th Ed) at 16-091) that, where two meanings are possible, the court should prefer one that validates the clause rather than renders it void or ineffective. HMRC submitted that MPHL did not bear the risks and rewards of the business via legal goodwill; furthermore, even if MPHL had access to proceeds by reference to legal goodwill, the appellants needed to provide evidence that the legal goodwill had monetary worth. No such valuation evidence was provided and none agreed, leaving only speculation as to the value. The tribunal accepted there was no evidence of the value, if any, of legal goodwill. Mr Winter reviewed authorities on legal goodwill, identifying a unifying thread that legal goodwill is inseparable from the business out of which it arises, as summarized in Halsbury’s Laws of England Vol 80 para 809. The tribunal examined Clause 9.1 of the MCP Deed stating “The goodwill of the Partnership shall be owned solely by MPHL,” noting “Partnership” is defined as the partnership subsisting between the partners (including any successor). The tribunal concluded that the reference to goodwill is to legal goodwill relating to the business carried on in common by the MCP partners, and, in line with case law, that such legal goodwill belonged to the partnership (MCP), not to MPHL, notwithstanding any contrary contractual provision. The tribunal agreed with HMRC’s submissions and rejected the appellants’ construction arguments. The tribunal reviewed and relied on case law including Wedderburn v Wedderburn (No 4) (1856) 52 ER 1039, IRC v Muller & Co’s Margarine Ltd [1901] AC 217, Star Industrial Co Ltd v Yap Kwee Kor (t/a New Star Industrial Co) [1976] FSR 256 (and Willers v Joyce [2016] UKSC 44 on the status of Privy Council decisions), Geraghty v Minter [1979] HCA 42, and TTYP (a Hong Kong CFA decision), all confirming that legal goodwill is inseparable from the business to which it attaches.\nThe Tribunal addressed arguments concerning the ownership and control of the Milton Park care home business and the recognition of purchased goodwill following the formation of a partnership (MCP). The Appellants relied on paragraph 10-100 of Lindley & Banks to argue that goodwill could be allocated outside the partnership, and further contended that MPHL retained control by being able to terminate or withdraw from the arrangements. The Tribunal held that the cited authorities remain good law but, on the facts, the presumption that goodwill belongs to the firm was not displaced: the MCP Deed of Partnership (including clause 9.1 and clause 14.2.1) did not expressly entitle MPHL to the proceeds of legal goodwill or confer a proprietary interest, and clause 14.2.1 on dissolution distributions was silent and amendable by the Managing Partner. The Tribunal found that, once the partnership was operating, control lay with MCP and its Managing Partner (SM). Under clause 12.2, a partner’s departure did not dissolve the partnership, and clause 16.2 required an outgoing partner to surrender partnership property; the Appellants acknowledged clause 16 avoids the need for dissolution. Thus MPHL or its subsidiary MPL could not withdraw and reclaim control; the business would continue under remaining partners. The suggestion that MPHL could exercise control by withdrawing use of real property was rejected; mere ability to shut down operations (“negative control”) is not control for accounting purposes. Control requires directing financial and operating policies to obtain economic benefits, per FRS 5.8, which MPHL did not possess. Any de facto control by MM (as owner of MPHL and related entities, and familial relationship with SM) did not equate to control by MPHL under the legal structure of the MCP Deed, which MM instructed, reviewed and signed. The Tribunal concluded MPHL did not acquire or retain control and thus could not recognise purchased goodwill under UK GAAP. In light of that finding, HMRC’s alternative derecognition argument did not need to be considered. The appeals were dismissed. Parties were advised of the right to apply for permission to appeal under Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009, with a 56-day deadline from the date the decision is sent. The decision was released on 14 November 2025.\nThis section addresses whether the goodwill of a partnership (the MCP) could be owned by a non-partner entity, MPHL, and whether provisions in the MCP Deed of Partnership (particularly clauses 9.1 and 14.2.1) confer on MPHL a present proprietary right or an entitlement to future sale proceeds from legal goodwill. The discussion considers authorities including TTYP (a Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal decision), Star Industrial, Muller, and commentary from Lindley & Banks on Partnership. The Tribunal records submissions from HMRC and the Appellants. HMRC argues that clause 9.1 is a straightforward declaration of ownership of legal goodwill and does not grant any entitlement to sale proceeds, and that clause 14.2.1 concerns dissolution and creates at most a debt obligation upon dissolution, not a proprietary right. The Appellants (through Mr Sykes) contend for a commonsense construction that clause 9.1 confers a right to sale proceeds attributable to legal goodwill. The Tribunal accepts that TTYP is persuasive (predating the National Security Law) and that Sir Anthony Mason in TTYP applied the inseparability principle, explaining that goodwill attaches to the business, not to its proprietor, and may pass to a licensee when expressly assigned. The Tribunal agrees with HMRC that case law does not support the proposition that the goodwill of a partnership can be owned by a non-partner where, at the time of the relevant transactions, MPHL was not a partner of the MCP. On construction, the Tribunal holds that clause 9.1, read naturally, declares ownership of legal goodwill but does not confer any entitlement to future sale proceeds, and even if it did, the nature of the right (proprietary vs contractual) is unclear, particularly as MPHL provided no consideration. The Tribunal finds that clause 14.2.1 operates only on dissolution: proceeds are applied first to debts and liabilities, with any sum realized from the disposal of business goodwill accruing solely to MPHL. The use of “accrue” indicates a debt obligation arising on dissolution, not a present proprietary entitlement to the asset or its proceeds, and the Managing Partner (SM) could amend the Deed to redirect proceeds, undermining any claimed secured entitlement by MPHL. The Tribunal rejects Mr Winter’s submission that certain High Court authorities cited in Lindley & Banks were per incuriam, finding that those authorities are consistent with the principle that goodwill is ordinarily a partnership asset but that this presumption may be rebutted in particular circumstances. On the facts and the wording of the MCP Deed, the presumption that goodwill belongs to the firm is not displaced, and the agreement does not treat goodwill as a separate asset owned by MPHL outside the firm.",

        "overview": "Appeals by Milton Park group companies against closure notices denying corporation tax deductions for amortisation of purchased goodwill and related group relief. The Tribunal had to decide whether MPHL’s accounts were prepared in accordance with GAAP such that goodwill could properly be recognised. The parties agreed valuation consequences depending on whether goodwill recognition was GAAP-compliant. The Tribunal addressed a preliminary application to admit late witness statements (admitted), confirmed the burden of proof lies on the Appellants, and heard extensive factual and expert accounting evidence concerning the recognition of goodwill linked to care home businesses operated through partnerships and companies connected to MM and EM.\nThis extract chronicles the formation and operation of the Milton Park Partnership (MPP), its admission of corporate partners BHL and BCSL to provide central services and staffing (including a profit-share for BCSL equal to staffing costs plus a 35% mark-up), the opening and operation of Milton Park Hospital, and a 2007 restructuring plan to incorporate the business under Section 162 TCGA 1992 into MPHL and MPL while preserving VAT efficiency and small-company disclosure status. It also records withdrawal of BHL and BCSL from MPP in late 2007 and continued staffing arrangements via a proposed Milton Care Partnership.\nThis section details the restructuring of the Milton Park care home business around late 2007 to early 2008. BCSL and BHL ceased as partners in the Milton Park Partnership (becoming creditors), while a new corporate vehicle, MPHL, acquired the partnership’s assets and liabilities as a going concern. MPL was tasked with day-to-day management for MPHL. A new partnership, Milton Care Partnership (MCP), was formed between MPL and SM from 1 January 2008, with SM as Managing Partner and goodwill owned by MPHL. BCSL joined MCP on 3 January 2008 to supply employees. Payment arrangements for BCSL and BHL in the interim were not formalized, and no separate fee was paid to BCSL between its MPP exit and MCP admission.\nChronological account of Milton Care Partnership developments: BCSL and BHL admitted as partners to supply staffing/administrative services on profit-share terms; goodwill retained by MPHL with partners’ rights limited for BCSL/BHL; regulatory scrutiny in 2008–2010 with BHL as registered person/owner for regulatory purposes; 2009 governance shift with MPHL assuming MPL’s role; 2009 property transfers citing FA 2003 Sch 15 Pt 3; 2013 partners’ resolution tied to refinancing and extension of BCSL arrangements; and 2015 sale of MPHL to Tracscare. Operationally, properties initially owned by MM/EM (no rent), staffing by BCSL/BHL, and Brookdale branding used.\nThis section describes operational, regulatory, and financial aspects of the Milton Park Hospital business, including BHL’s centralised regulatory role, use of the Brookdale branding, staffing by BCSL and BHL, and property transfers to MPHL. It details MPHL’s and MPL’s financial reporting, notably substantial goodwill recognition, amortisation and impairment, and minimal turnover, as well as a 2015 share sale to Tracscare. It sets out the tax positions taken by MPHL (goodwill deductions) and MPL (group relief claim) and HMRC’s enquiries and closure notices in 2019 disallowing goodwill amortisation and reducing MPL’s group relief, with those conclusions upheld on review.\nExpert evidence (Dr Alford) addresses GAAP treatment of goodwill arising from MPHL’s 2009 transaction, contrasting valuations (£174.59m vs £51.94m) and their impact on amortisation and GAAP compliance through 2017. A hypothetical regulatory requirement related to Care Standards Act registration is considered for its effect on whether MPHL (or MCP) acquired and operated the business. The Tribunal also sets out undisputed legislation governing tax treatment of goodwill under FA 2002 Sch 29 and CTA 2009 Part 8 and lists relevant FRSs.\nHMRC disallowed goodwill amortisation claimed by MPHL across multiple accounting periods (2008–2017) and adjusted MPL’s 2009 group relief position, resulting in tax assessments. These amendments were upheld on review. The dispute involves whether MPHL acquired a business for GAAP purposes and whether recognising and continuing to amortise goodwill in MPHL’s accounts was appropriate, including any derecognition upon subsequent operation through MPL. Competing expert evidence addresses the application of UK GAAP (FRS 6, FRS 5, FRS 10) and the allocation of risks, rewards, and control over the business operations.\nDispute about whether MPHL correctly recognised purchased goodwill under UK GAAP following its December 2007 acquisition of the MPP care home business and whether later delegation of operations to MPL and formation of MCP required derecognition. Appellants say control, risks, and rewards remained with MPHL; HMRC says MCP operated the business and MPHL lacked operational control, so goodwill was not recognisable or should have been derecognised/valued lower.\nThe tribunal considers whether transactions involving MPHL and MPP constituted a business combination under FRS 6 by assessing whether MPHL obtained control over MPP’s net assets and operations. The Appellants’ expert relied on IFRS 3/FRED 36 to define “business,” but the tribunal agrees with HMRC that UK GAAP (FRSSE, FRS 5, FRS 6) governs and provides adequate definitions, rendering reliance on IFRS unnecessary. Control over net assets appears satisfied (subject to substance‑over‑form), and the tribunal emphasises analysing the series of transactions as a whole to identify where risks and rewards reside to determine control over operations.\nDispute over whether, in substance and for GAAP purposes, the care home business and its goodwill were transferred to the new partnership MCP or retained by MPHL. Applying FRS 5.14’s substance-over-form approach to a pre-ordained series of transactions, the Tribunal assessed who controlled the business and bore its risks and rewards. The Tribunal found that MCP, led by its Managing Partner SM, operated and controlled the business, with MCP’s accounts recording all turnover and expenses, and that MPHL did not retain control or goodwill for accounting recognition.\nWhether MCP operated the care home business (rather than merely managing it for MPHL) and whether MPL acted as MPHL’s agent. The tribunal relied on MCP’s accounting for all turnover and costs as evidencing control under accounting principles (SoP 2.6). Branding/registration under BHL were not determinative; decisive were MCP’s partnership composition and control of staff. The asserted agency of MPL for MPHL was undermined by lack of an explicit agency appointment by MPHL and absence of remuneration, applying agency law principles.\nThe Tribunal considered whether MPHL retained significant benefits/risks and control over the business’s profits and sale proceeds under FRS 5 after forming MCP. Based on the MCP Deed and evidence of how profits were determined, it found control lay with SM as Managing Partner, not MPHL; therefore, FRS 5.25 did not support recognising or continuing to recognise goodwill in MPHL’s accounts, and MPHL did not control proceeds of any future sale or profits arising from income.\nThe Tribunal considered whether MPL acted as agent for MPHL and whether MPHL retained the principal risks and rewards of the care home business under GAAP (FRS 5). HMRC argued there was no agency and that MPHL did not retain significant benefits/risks; the Appellants, via expert PC, argued MPHL retained control over benefits and bore principal risks. The Tribunal agreed with HMRC, rejecting agency, finding operations passed to MCP, and holding MPHL’s retained rights were not significant in practice under FRS 5.25.\nDispute concerns whether MPHL retained control and the risks and rewards of a care home business for GAAP/FRS 5 purposes, focusing on who controlled profit allocation, access to sale proceeds, bearing of losses, and treatment of goodwill under the MCP Deed and admission deeds.\nIssue on whether references to “goodwill” in the MCP Deed mean legal goodwill and whether such goodwill (and proceeds attributable to it) could belong to MPHL rather than the MCP partnership. The tribunal held that legal goodwill is inseparable from the business and thus belongs to the partnership (MCP), not MPHL; also, no evidence was adduced as to the monetary value of any legal goodwill.\nThe case concerns whether MPHL, following the formation of the MCP partnership to operate the Milton Park care home business, controlled the business such that it could recognise purchased goodwill under UK GAAP. The Tribunal rejected the Appellants’ reliance on Lindley & Banks paragraph 10-100 to allocate goodwill outside the partnership and found MPHL lacked control under FRS 5.8; control resided with MCP and its Managing Partner. Appeals dismissed.\nIssue: whether MPHL, a non-partner, owned the partnership’s legal goodwill or had an entitlement to sale proceeds under the MCP Deed of Partnership. Held: TTYP is persuasive on the inseparability of goodwill from the business; case law does not support ownership of partnership goodwill by a non-partner in these circumstances. On construction, clause 9.1 does not confer an entitlement to sale proceeds and clause 14.2.1 creates only a debt obligation on dissolution; the Deed’s amendability further undermines any claimed proprietary entitlement. The presumption that goodwill is a partnership asset is not rebutted on these facts."

        "dicta": "- Lateness of evidence, without more, was not a compelling reason to refuse admission where the evidence was relevant; any issue goes to weight.\n- The burden of proof is on the Appellants to show the closure notice conclusions are wrong on the balance of probabilities.\n- The Tribunal need not address every point in submissions; it is sufficient to consider key issues and material referred to.\n- Both GAAP experts were qualified to give expert evidence.\nThe Tribunal noted the relevant legislation governing goodwill taxation was undisputed and that FA 2002 Sch 29 and CTA 2009 Part 8 are materially to the same effect; therefore, FA 2002 provisions were cited with cross-references to CTA 2009.\nUK GAAP governs: where UK standards (FRSSE, FRS 5, FRS 6) address the issue, international standards like IFRS 3 and FRED 36 are advisory and should not displace extant UK standards, particularly when not in force and when they exclude common‑control combinations. FRS 6 focuses on whether control over net assets and operations is obtained; importing a separate definition of “business” is unnecessary. Substance over form requires viewing a series of transactions as a whole and giving greater weight to commercially effective aspects; control is linked to access to benefits and bearing associated risks.\nA group or series of transactions designed to achieve an overall commercial effect should be viewed as a whole (FRS 5.14). Legal declarations of ownership cannot override the objective assessment of control required under GAAP. The Tribunal must assess who had the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of the business with a view to obtaining economic benefits; on the evidence, that power rested with MCP and its Managing Partner, SM.\nMCP’s recognition of all turnover and costs for the care home evidences that it, not MPHL, controlled the business. MPHL’s failure to record any income or expenditure associated with the business is inconsistent with SoP 2.6 and undermines the notion that MPHL presented a true and fair view. Ownership of trademarks and registration under the Care Standards Act 2000 by BHL is not determinative of who operated the care home. Determinative is that BHL and BCSL were partners in MCP and MCP, through SM, controlled staff and administrative services. Minutes of MPHL did not record any agency appointment of MPL; absent express or implied assent, agency is not established by assertions in MPL’s minutes.\nSignificance under FRS 5.25 is assessed by reference to benefits and risks likely to occur in practice; contingent, discretionary, or practically unenforceable rights are not significant. Ownership of real property does not equate to control of the business where the property is not a partnership asset and can be replaced. Control over profit allocation and access to sale proceeds vested in the MCP Managing Partner under the Deed; minutes do not show MM exercising decision-making authority. Informal or undocumented familial understandings cannot displace the objective legal and accounting analysis under GAAP; even if MM exercised de facto control, that would be his personal control, not control by MPHL.\nThe absence of any remuneration for MPL, lack of evident benefit to MPHL, absence of limitations on MPL’s discretion, and the accounting records all point away from an agency relationship. Even if MPL were acting as an agent, that would not establish that MPHL had control for GAAP purposes; control under FRS 5.8 requires the ability to direct the financial and operating policies with a view to obtaining economic benefits. Rights must be significant in practice under FRS 5.25; theoretical or contingent rights, or rights subject to others’ discretion (e.g., the Managing Partner), do not suffice.\nControl for GAAP purposes depends on who has the authority to determine the distribution of future economic benefits, not on how profits were actually distributed. The MCP Deed vested profit-allocation and operational control in the Managing Partner (SM), not MPHL. Ownership of real property used by the partnership does not make it partnership property; losses are borne by partners. Clauses addressing goodwill concern legal goodwill and do not establish GAAP control or ownership of accounting goodwill.\n- Legal goodwill is inseparable from the business out of which it arises; it cannot subsist independently and attaches to the business rather than an individual proprietor. - Clause 9.1’s “goodwill of the Partnership” necessarily refers to legal goodwill of the partnership business carried on in common; despite the deed stating otherwise, that legal goodwill belongs to the partnership (MCP), not MPHL. - Without evidence of monetary value for legal goodwill, any access to proceeds by reference to legal goodwill would be immaterial. - Authorities cited include Wedderburn v Wedderburn (No 4), IRC v Muller & Co’s Margarine Ltd, Star Industrial (noting Privy Council decisions are persuasive per Willers v Joyce), Geraghty v Minter, and TTYP.\n- The presumption that goodwill belongs to the firm is rebuttable and depends on the partnership agreement and context; paragraph 10-100 of Lindley & Banks does not establish a rule permitting free allocation of goodwill to non-partners. - Clauses 9.1 and 14.2.1 of the MCP Deed did not give MPHL an entitlement to legal goodwill or confer a proprietary interest; clause 14.2.1 was silent and amendable by the Managing Partner. - A partner’s ability to withdraw or terminate arrangements does not amount to control; negative control (ability to shut down) is insufficient for accounting control. - Control in the relevant sense requires the ability to direct financial and operating policies to obtain economic benefits (FRS 5.8). - Any de facto control by MM personally or through other entities does not equate to control by MPHL given the legal structure of the MCP Deed.\nGoodwill is personal property inseparable from and attached to the business, not to its proprietor, and may pass with the business, including to a licensee where expressly assigned. The natural and objective reading of clause 9.1 concerns ownership of legal goodwill as an asset, not entitlement to future sale proceeds. The term “accrue” in clause 14.2.1 signifies a right arising upon dissolution, consistent with a debt obligation rather than present proprietary entitlement. The general presumption that goodwill belongs to the firm may be rebutted, but that depends on construction of the partnership agreement and the factual matrix; it is relatively rare for goodwill to be owned outside the firm.",
        "reasoning": "The Tribunal considered the Appellants’ application to admit late evidence against HMRC’s objections grounded in prior directions. It assessed relevance and the likelihood that the witnesses would refer to the statements during oral evidence, deciding to admit them and leaving questions of weight for submissions. It set the framework of the case by identifying the central GAAP issue and recording the parties’ agreements on valuation and tax consequences under alternative factual findings. It noted the burden of proof lies with the Appellants and confirmed reliance on the hearing transcript and extensive bundles. The Tribunal evaluated the witness and expert evidence, largely accepting JA’s and MM’s testimony (subject to exceptions), giving limited weight to LM’s hearsay evidence, and acknowledging both accounting experts’ qualifications before proceeding to findings of fact, including the formation and evolution of the Milton Park Partnership and subsequent business arrangements.\nThe Tribunal summarised statutory mechanics for bringing amortisation and impairment into account, determining tax written down value, and recognising amounts for accounting purposes (including adjustments where accounts are not GAAP-compliant), highlighting the linkage between GAAP and tax outcomes.\nThe tribunal assessed the hierarchy and applicability of accounting standards. It found that FRS 6 remained applicable at the relevant time and that FRSSE’s reference to “other accounting standards” pertains to UK standards and UITF abstracts, not IFRS. Since IFRS 3/FRED 36 exclude common‑control transactions and were not in force, they do not provide the operative framework. The tribunal then identified the correct FRS 6 test: whether MPHL obtained control over MPP’s net assets and operations. It reviewed authoritative definitions of control (FRS 5, SOP), distinguishing control from mere management and linking control to risks and rewards. On evidence, and subject to assumptions about the Transfer Agreement and witness statements, HMRC’s expert accepted MPHL gained control over net assets, which HMRC’s skeleton also acknowledged, but flagged the need for a substance‑over‑form analysis. The tribunal emphasised that the transactions must be evaluated as a whole to determine where risks and rewards truly lay, in order to assess control over operations.\nThe Tribunal considered the entire series of transactions and their commercial effect, as required by FRS 5.14 and FRSSE 2.2. It found that the transactions were pre-ordained to move the business from MPP to MCP and that, in practice, operational control and economic benefits passed to MCP and SM. The MCP Deed of Partnership stated the partners would carry on the business for their mutual benefit, and designated SM as Managing Partner with the final say on profit allocation. Cross-examination confirmed MCP operated the care home business for the partners, not as a manager for MPHL. MCP’s financial statements recorded all turnover and operating expenses; MPHL’s accounts showed no trading income and described it as a holding company. The Tribunal gave greater weight to these practical features than to Clause 9 reserving legal goodwill to MPHL, concluding that legal ownership statements do not determine control for accounting purposes. Therefore, under GAAP, MPHL did not control the business and could not recognise goodwill.\nThe tribunal applied substance-over-form, focusing on control of economic outcomes. MCP’s accounts included turnover and cost of sales consistent with operating a care home, and lacked any management-fee structure expected of a mere manager, aligning with SoP 2.6. Witness MM accepted the accounts gave a true and fair view. Expert EA’s interpretation under SoP 2.6 supported that MCP controlled profits, losses, assets, and liabilities. The tribunal rejected PC’s contrary view as inconsistent with the accounting evidence and MPHL’s omission to recognise any business income or costs. HMRC’s branding/registration points were discounted but the partnership structure and control over staff were decisive. On agency, comparison of MPL and MPHL minutes and the absence of remuneration, viewed through Bowstead & Reynolds’ definition of agency, indicated no express or implied agency.\nThe Tribunal analysed the MCP Deed of Partnership: Clause 8.2 vested profit-share determinations in the Managing Partner (SM) where partners disagreed, and Clause 14.2.3 tied any surplus/sale proceeds to the profit-sharing ratios immediately prior to dissolution—ratios which SM controlled. Evidence from MM and JA confirmed SM’s autonomy over profit allocation. The minutes corroborated that MCP, directed by SM, decided profit allocations; one outlier minute referencing MM’s direction did not override the Deed or demonstrate MM’s control. The rights asserted by MPHL (ability to terminate MPL’s role, real property ownership, purported goodwill entitlement) were either contingent, discretionary, or practically unenforceable and did not permit MPHL to direct MCP’s financial and operating policies, as required by FRS 5.8. PC’s expert opinion attributing profits to MPHL based on actual allocations was undermined by his concession that GAAP looks to who holds the authority to control future economic benefits; that authority lay with SM as Managing Partner. The alleged “informal family understanding” was unsupported by evidence and, even if it existed, could not displace the legal structure or confer control on MPHL under GAAP.\nThe Tribunal evaluated the documentary evidence (MPHL Board minutes of 31 December 2007), accounting treatments (MPL recognising turnover from MCP; MPHL recognising investment income only), and absence of any agency remuneration or constraints on MPL’s autonomy. It considered expert PC’s suggested accounting treatment under Application Note G of FRS 5 if an agency existed, finding this underscored the absence of an agency agreement. Oral testimony (MM and JA) indicated MPL was used as a subsidiary vehicle to channel profits to MPHL, not as agent, aligning with HMRC’s explanation. Applying FRS 5.8, the Tribunal concluded MPHL lacked the power to direct financial and operating policies of the business. On risks and rewards, the Tribunal weighed PC’s assertions about MPHL’s access to sale proceeds and residual profits against EA’s analysis of MCP’s governance: the Managing Partner (Sean McInerney) determined profit allocations, corporate partners had no voting rights, and MPL had full autonomy. Accepting HMRC’s submissions on FRS 5.25, the Tribunal determined the rights cited by the Appellants were not significant in practice, being contingent or subject to others’ discretion, and thus did not amount to MPHL retaining the principal risks and rewards.\nThe Tribunal relied on concessions by the Appellants’ expert (PC) that actual profit allocations are not determinative under GAAP and that the key is authority over future economic benefits. It examined the MCP Deed: Clause 8.2 grants SM final authority over profit shares; Clause 14 ties dissolution distributions to profit-sharing proportions and allocates legal goodwill proceeds to MPHL. Evidence showed SM, not MPHL, controlled access to sale proceeds. On risk-bearing, the Tribunal distinguished between partnership property and assets owned by a partner; despite MPHL owning the real property, it was not partnership property and thus losses would be borne by partners, not MPHL’s property assets. On goodwill, although documents state legal goodwill belongs to MPHL, this does not demonstrate retention of GAAP control. Accordingly, the Tribunal agreed with HMRC that MPHL did not retain control of the economic benefits and risks under GAAP.\nThe tribunal recorded the concession that the deed’s references to “goodwill” are to legal goodwill, not accounting goodwill. It rejected the appellants’ reliance on validation-oriented construction principles because those could not override the established legal nature of goodwill. The tribunal accepted HMRC’s submissions that MPHL did not bear the risks and rewards of the business through legal goodwill and that the appellants had provided no evidence of any monetary value for legal goodwill. Interpreting the MCP Deed, the tribunal found that “goodwill of the Partnership” refers to legal goodwill of the business carried on in common by the partners. Under the cited authorities, legal goodwill cannot be separated from the business to which it attaches and is owned by the partnership conducting the business. Therefore, any provision purporting to vest that legal goodwill in MPHL was ineffective as a matter of law. Accordingly, the tribunal agreed with HMRC and rejected the appellants’ submissions.\nThe Tribunal evaluated the partnership deed’s terms and the operational structure after formation of MCP. It found no express provision giving MPHL rights to goodwill proceeds or a proprietary interest, and noted dissolution distribution terms were amendable by the Managing Partner, undermining any claim that goodwill was held outside the firm. It considered termination arguments and found that partner withdrawal did not dissolve MCP (clause 12.2) and required surrender of partnership property (clause 16.2), so MPHL/MPL could not reclaim control; the business would continue with remaining partners. The Tribunal assessed the concept of control, rejecting the notion that withdrawing property use confers control and adopting FRS 5.8’s definition. It concluded that control of the business and its economic benefits sat with MCP, specifically its Managing Partner SM, not MPHL. Any alleged de facto control by MM could not override the governing legal instrument (the MCP Deed), which he had instructed, reviewed, and signed. Consequently, MPHL did not acquire a business for UK GAAP purposes and could not recognise purchased goodwill; HMRC’s alternative derecognition argument was moot.\nThe Tribunal considered TTYP and accepted its articulation of the inseparability principle. It compared the parties’ authorities and found none cited by the Appellants established that partnership goodwill can be owned by a non-partner where, at the relevant times, MPHL was not a partner. Interpreting clause 9.1, the Tribunal applied ordinary contractual construction and concluded the clause declares ownership but does not grant a right to sale proceeds; even if it did, the nature of such right (proprietary vs contractual) is ambiguous, particularly as MPHL was a volunteer without consideration. Turning to clause 14.2.1, the Tribunal read it as a dissolution distribution mechanism: proceeds are first used to pay debts/liabilities, with any sum from goodwill then accruing to MPHL. The word “accrue” indicates a contingent debt obligation arising on dissolution, not present ownership of proceeds. The Deed’s amendability by the Managing Partner (SM) further shows MPHL lacks secured access to proceeds. The Tribunal rejected the per incuriam challenge to High Court authorities referenced in Lindley & Banks, finding those authorities consistent with the rebuttable presumption that goodwill is a partnership asset. Applying that presumption and the Deed’s terms, the Tribunal concluded the presumption is not displaced in this case and goodwill was not intended to be a separate asset owned by MPHL outside the firm."

    "decision": {
        "conclusion": "Appeal dismissed. The accounts were not drawn up in accordance with GAAP; no goodwill should have been recognised for the purposes of the claimed deductions and group relief.\nApplying FRS 5.14, the Tribunal concluded that the business operations passed to MCP and that MPHL did not acquire or retain control over the business and was not entitled to recognise goodwill in its accounts.\nMPHL did not retain significant benefits or risks under FRS 5.25 and did not control the proceeds of any future sale or profits arising from the business; control over profit allocation and sale proceeds lay with SM as Managing Partner of MCP. Recognition or continued recognition of goodwill in MPHL’s accounts is not supported by FRS 5.25.\nThe Tribunal rejected the submission that MPL acted as MPHL’s agent, found that the operations of MPL passed to MCP, and determined that MPHL did not retain significant benefits or risks within the meaning of FRS 5.25.\nThe appellants’ submissions on goodwill were rejected and HMRC’s submissions accepted. Legal goodwill of the MCP business is inseparable from the business and belongs to the partnership (MCP), not MPHL; there was no evidence of any monetary value of legal goodwill.\nAppeals dismissed. MPHL did not acquire control over the Milton Park care home business after formation of MCP and was not entitled to recognise purchased goodwill under UK GAAP; HMRC’s alternative derecognition argument was not considered.\nThe Tribunal rejects the Appellants’ case that MPHL owned the partnership’s legal goodwill or had a proprietary entitlement to its sale proceeds. Clause 9.1 does not confer a right to sale proceeds, and clause 14.2.1 creates only a contingent debt on dissolution. The presumption that goodwill belongs to the partnership is not rebutted on the facts.",
        "reasoning_summary": "Because MPHL’s accounts were not GAAP-compliant as regards recognition of goodwill, no amortisation or impairment debits were allowable and MPL was not entitled to group relief based on such debits; the agreed alternative valuation and consequential relief did not arise.\nThe commercial substance, assessed as a whole, showed MCP and its Managing Partner controlled operations and profits, evidenced by the MCP Deed and MCP’s accounting records, whereas MPHL’s role was a holding company with no trading income; legal wording reserving goodwill to MPHL could not override GAAP’s control analysis.\nBased on the MCP Deed clauses allocating power to SM, witness evidence, meeting minutes, and GAAP/FRS 5 principles, the Tribunal determined that MPHL’s cited rights were contingent or discretionary and did not amount to practical control over the business’s economic benefits.\nNo documentary or accounting evidence of agency; MPL had full autonomy; relationship better characterised as parent–subsidiary; even if agency existed, MPHL lacked GAAP control per FRS 5.8. Under FRS 5.25, MPHL’s rights were contingent and not significant in practice, particularly given MCP’s governance and the Managing Partner’s discretion over profit allocations.\nLegal goodwill attaches to and is owned by the business/partnership; deed provisions cannot alter that legal position, and no valuation evidence was provided to give legal goodwill any demonstrated monetary value.\nGoodwill presumptions were not displaced by the MCP Deed’s terms; control under FRS 5.8 requires the power to direct financial and operating policies to obtain economic benefits, which resided with MCP and its Managing Partner SM, not MPHL. Termination or withdrawal rights and de facto personal influence did not constitute control.\nAuthorities and contractual construction support HMRC’s interpretation: goodwill attaches to the business; clause 9.1 is a declaration of ownership of legal goodwill, not of sale proceeds; clause 14.2.1’s use of “accrue” denotes a debt arising on dissolution; and the Deed’s amendability and lack of consideration to MPHL negate any proprietary entitlement. The general presumption that goodwill is a partnership asset stands on these facts."
